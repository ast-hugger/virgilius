# I. ON THE NOUN

As I prepare to set forth the first exposition, dearest brother, concerning the art of the noun—which is indeed the first—and as I desire to satisfy your requests, it seems to me that a discourse must first be made through the cases one by one.

**On the nominative case.** The first case is the *rectus* [the upright one], called the nominative, and it must be known in which syllables it ends, since some say that the nominative case must always end in only three syllables, while others say the contrary—in six. From this point, an investigation of opposing views discovered this question and wished to direct it to my humble self—your most sagacious investigation, which has been well-proven in divine volumes. What then am I to do, when rivals exist on both sides and I am positioned with a friend on each flank, compelled to please amid their quarrels?

There are two schools in all of Europe where these controversies are for the most part carried on: the school of Terrentius and the school of Galbungus. Terrentius asserts that there are only three syllables, as I said, in which the nominative case must end—except for the comparative degree, where the syllable *-or* is sometimes received—three customary syllables established in antiquity through the three genders: *-us*, *-a*, *-um*. He affirms that beyond these nothing at all can be accepted. And conversely Galbungus urges that the nominative case must end in six syllables: *-us*, *-a*, *-um* as in *doctus*, *docta*, *doctum*; then in *-es* as in *facies*; then in *-as* as in *uoluntas*; then in *-e* as in *omne*. We ought to believe this opinion, but we believe not only this opinion; indeed, many genders go out into these same syllables—as in *-us* two genders, masculine and neuter, such as *mancus* and *impus*. But Greek nouns have corrupted every rule of syllables and genders.

Many have written much about the nominative case; but among other things you especially asked why we have in use the masculine and feminine and neuter in speaking. Some simply said that the masculine ought to be that which would be shown according to the disposition of the body, and likewise the feminine—such as *uir* [man] and *mulier* [woman], *taurus* [bull] and *uacca* [cow], *aries* [ram] and *ouis* [ewe], *canis* [dog] and *cata* [cat] and other animals. But they held that all material things, such as stones and trees and whatever is similar, ought to be called neuter. Hence they used to say "*hic uir* and *haec mulier* and *hoc lapis* and *hoc arbor* and *hoc cera* and *hoc panis* and *hoc domus* and *hoc manus*." I therefore advise you, O dearest brother, that although we do not now employ this custom of writing, nevertheless because this was held as correct among the ancients, if perchance you come upon something of this sort in writing, although you may think it should not be referred to indubitable authority, nevertheless what has been adopted by the ancients you ought by no means to criticize. Yet these three genders were established for a certain distinction by those skilled and wise in the craft of philosophy, so that under these names of the genders a certain distinguished order of statements and opinions might be more easily described.

But since we have undertaken to speak about the nominative case, a question presents itself to us: why is a double nominative singular case found for a single noun, when through all the cases there is one and the same declension? Thus we say *sepes sepis* and *seps sepis*, *Cebes Cebitis* and *Chebs Chebitis*, likewise *preces precis*, *prex precis*, *sedes sedis* and *ses sedis*, and so forth. This is understood chiefly on account of the necessity of meters and the positioning of feet to be measured and of quantities. This however must be known: that whenever *sepes* is said, the material of stones is indicated, but when *seps* is written, it will always be of wood. Thus when you say *preces*, it will be a shameless and impudent request and especially a demand for something bad; but *prex* will always be directed toward a good purpose. But when *sedes* is said, it is of a simple place, of whatever sort, in which someone might sit; while *ses* is of another composition and of a higher place prepared for sitting, which in Greek is called *thronus*: whence also he who sits in it is named *thors*, that is, king.

There are nevertheless certain nouns which are known to have two declensions throughout all cases, such as *laetitia* and *laetamen*, *uocatio* and *uocamen*, *praesagium* and *praesagimen*, *fundamentum* and *fundamen*, *monimentum* and *monimen*, *calciamentum* and *calciamen*, *examentum* and *examen*, *stramentum* and *stramen*, *firmamentum* and *firmamen*, *species* and *specimen*, and so forth. Indeed we add this: that three or even four declensions occur for many nouns, as there is *laetitia*, *laetities*, *laetamen*. But some of these have a distinction, while others are said to be written for the sake of invention alone; yet this is denied by most of the learned to be at all possible, since they affirm that no noun or verb or any part of speech whatsoever—indeed, hardly any syllable or letter—could have been written that was not full of reason or possessed of some property of its own. We therefore, when we say *laetitia*, signify a stable joy of the mind and one that is in some sense enduring; and if we say *laetities*, we understand it to be sudden; and *laetamen* we indicate as the favor of some added congratulation.

There is also *uesper*, *uespere*, *uesperum*, *uespera*. This nominative case is fourfold; of which the distinction will be this: that *uesper* indeed is said whenever the sun is covered by clouds or the moon by hazes at whatever hour of day or night, and this is neuter—*uesper uesperis uesper uespere*. But *uespere* in the nominative is called from the ninth hour when the sun begins its departure; but this noun has no declension. *Uesperum* however is when with the setting sun the day fails, and it is thus declined: *uesperum uesperi uespero uesperum uespero*. *Uespera* is when, with the dawn of light rising, the night ends: for just as day has *uesperum* at the succession of night, so also night has *uespera* at the rising of day, and it is thus declined: *uespera uesperae uesperam uespera*. Care must be taken, however, lest *uesper* or *uesperum* or *uespera* be thought to have a plural number. Whence I wonder how a certain person most brazenly dared to say *uesperes*; and he not only confusedly assumed the plural number against all order and reason, but also corrupted the gender itself, putting masculine for neuter. But I do not wish to reveal openly the name of such a man, since he is noble and rather famous and perhaps his disgrace would displease many—especially since he confessed that he said this not only boldly but also rashly, and he laid his face upon my breast. But let enough be said about this man.

For the rest, in writing the nominative case many superfluously and corruptly either add much or diminish, as is *brachium*, when here *h* ought not to be written. Many also say *fillius* instead of what is *filius*: thus Maceronto the Greek pupil, admonishing disciples not yet complete—or rather daring to admonish and, to speak more correctly, corrupting—said "*fillius* meus es tu." And I wonder whence he added *l* in the nominative singular case, when in the plural number he wrote, as is proper, "*moneo uos, filii mei*." They say indeed *cerus* for *ceruus*; and yet they decline *cerui ceruo* and the rest; and yet it is so foreign and barbarous that whence it was brought cannot be understood.

**Now concerning the genitive case.** Every genitive case ending in the letter *-i* is doubtful, for it is either long or short: long is that which ends in double *-i*, as *bracii*, *filii*, *gobii*; short is that which terminates in a single *-i*, as *docti*, *stili*, *domi*—although some consider that this case, whenever it terminates in *-i*, ought to be made long. We do not distinguish the nature of syllables and quantities in this work, but we simply discuss how the cases themselves are to be positioned. For it is not because the genitive case is said to be lengthened that it will therefore produce an extension of sound through the length of quantities, unless either *-i* shall have been doubled or *-e* added with aspiration. For the genitive ending in the diphthong *-ae* indeed lengthens the natures, but unless *-e* is doubled, it does not extend the sound. Every genitive case ending in *-is* or in *-us* must always be shortened; although some think that every declining case has no genitive, but is defective in this case—so that one says *haec manus* in the nominative, *huic manu* in the dative, yet so that they do not reject the genitive plural.

You also asked why in the school of Galbungus *-i* is customarily added in the genitive case *doctii* when in the nominative it is *doctus*. This was the reason. A certain Mitterius, a Spaniard, whom we trusted as a prophet—he used to testify with undoubting assertion that both are permissible in verses as one might wish: *doctus* and *doctius*, *sanctus* and *sanctius*, *uerus* and *uerius*, *perfectus* and *perfectius*, and so in the genitive *doctii*, *sanctii*, *uerii*, *perfectii*. This old man then (and very old indeed) came to my house by night; when I had received him most gratefully, he said to me: "O son, ask me if something is on your heart, and I in place of good hospitality will refresh you." And I say to him: "I have something to ask you: there are certain similar things which cannot be distinguished by me, which some call nouns, others pronouns, others adverbs, and so forth—which you yourself both propose and resolve, since I do not even grasp how to ask."

Then he, as if inspired by some spirit, said prophetically: "I know, my son, what is the question of your heart. There are indeed nouns which are manifestly adverbs with the same letters, as *una una*, *tria tria*. This then will be the distinction: that when it is a noun, the first syllable is lengthened, the last shortened; but when an adverb, the first syllable shortened, the last lengthened. There are also pronouns and adverbs which are said to be with the same letters, unless they differ in sound, as *hic hic*. But if you wish to write more correctly and better, you will write the adverb with double *-i*, as *hiic*. There are also those pronouns similar to verbs, as *ego ego*, *is is*, *quis quis*, *tui tui*, *tibi tibi*. But if *ego* be a verb, the first syllable will be lengthened—*ego*, which means 'I live.'"

But this must be investigated: by what distinction these three similar words—*ago*, *ego*, *egeo*—are to be distinguished. When therefore you write *ago*, in the past tense write *aegi* with the aspiration of the diphthong; but *ego* lacks the diphthong and is thus conjugated: *ego egis*, and in the past tense *egi*, shortened. But if you extend the final syllable, you will be free of all error—just as if in the aforementioned *aegi* you lengthen the first syllable, you do most correctly, especially since it has a diphthong. When you write *is* as a verb, you will always lengthen it, as *eo is*, just as from *queo*, *quis*. But when you write the pronouns with the letters *is*, *eius*, *quis*, *cuius*, always shorten these monosyllables. And when you write *tui* pronominally, you ought to lengthen the first syllable, *tui*; but when you write *tui* in the imperative mood of the active verb, the following syllable is lengthened. This verb is *tuo*, *tuis*, *tuit*; and its meaning is "I see clearly." But if you say *tueor*, *tueris* concerning guardianship, it will be a deponent verb of the second conjugation. Thus with *tibi*, if you write the final syllable in the dative case of the definite pronoun, *tibi*; but if you write in the imperative mood of that active verb which is *tibio*, you ought to accent the first syllable. For *tibio* has this meaning: "I play the lyre"—for the *tibia* is a certain kind of singing.

There is also a verb and an adverb customarily written with the same letters, *esto esto*: for *esto* of the neutral verb is in the imperative mood, future tense, whose first syllable ought to be accented. But if *esto* shall be an adverb, with the first syllable shortened, the latter is necessarily accented. The meaning of this adverb *esto* is "rightly," according to that saying of Galbungus: "*esto*," he says, "they live, because they despise the flabby luxuries of the world"—that is, "they live rightly." There is also *esto*, which is customarily taken for "perhaps": "With the ethereal one helping, *esto* may the Romans be able to conquer in a later time"—that is, he used *esto* for "perhaps."

*Sua sua sua*—noun and pronoun and verb. The noun *sua* is feminine, that is, a house in which scholarly men compose their writings or sayings aptly and sweetly. There is also the verb *sua* of the first conjugation, active, that is "persuade," according to that saying of Cicero: "*suate*," he says, "men and brothers, that they may be for the peace of Rome." This Cicero is most inventive in every art, so that it came into a proverb among all authors of philosophy: "He has not read who has not read Cicero." *Sua* therefore as a pronoun has both vowels lengthened with a circumflex; but as a noun, *sua* is short in both vowels, so that the middle *u* through the synalepha of two vowels is not only shortened but also nearly extinguished. Thus it is to be understood concerning *suo*. But since when we began to speak about the genitive case our discourse has arrived by another course and as if into another region, so that one thought would seem to impede another, let enough therefore be said about the genitive case, lest a long discourse exceed the measure of the volume.

**But let us say a few things about the genitive plural.** Every genitive case ending in *-ium* as a syllable has many rules and many causes. For indeed, beyond that original rule which everyone speaks in common and ordinary speech—that is, when the ablative singular case ends in *-i*—so from other paradigms the genitive customarily ends in *-ium* in the plural, when either the nominative shall have been terminated in two semivowels, which are *-ns* and *-rs*, and the ablative case shall have ended in *-e*, as *mons*, *ars*, *sors*, *mors*, *prudens*, *sapiens*, *ingens*; and in the ablative *monte*, *arte*, *sorte*, *morte*, *prudente*, *sapiente*, *ingente*. One ought not therefore say in the ablative *ab hac arti* or *monti*, although some have said this most corruptly. And in the genitive plural it must be said thus: *montium*, *artium*, *partium*, *mortium*, *prudentium*, *sapientium*, *ingentium*. A third rule is added, on account of which the ablative case ends in *-e* and the genitive case ends in *-ium*, when a noun of feminine gender shall have ended in short *-e* in the ablative case, as *ab hac clade*, *ab hac ciuitate*, *ab hac uirtute*, *ab hac urbe*, *ab hac fame*, *ab hac mole*, *ab hac quiete*, and they send the genitive plural into *-ium*, as *cladium*, *ciuitatium*, *uirtutium*, *urbium*, *famium*, *molium*, *quietium*. This much concerning the genitive.

**Now, what the dative case indicates** must be followed from the rules and words of those who both learned and handed down concerning the individual principles of the arts lawfully and diligently: the dative case, they say, in vernacular fashion indicates a neutral verb. But nevertheless this rule is not to be observed through all verbs and cases, if it serves special inventions, customs, and principles—as if you say *placeo tibi*, *displiceo tibi*, *gaudeo tibi*, and similar things. The dative case in *-i* must always be accented, except for that case which is counted by four syllables, provided that three syllables are placed in the nominative, as *potestas*, *ciuitas*, *pietas*, *claritas*. But if the nominative singular case shall have been disyllabic, and both syllables shall have been short, the dative case will be accented on the latter syllable, as *igni*, *pani*, *naui*. But if the prior syllable of the nominative case shall have been acute, the latter of the dative case will be shortened, as *cladi*, *fami*. But if the nominative case shall have been monosyllabic—of that sort at least which shall have been long by nature—its first syllable must be accented in every case and the remaining syllables shortened.

**Concerning the dative and ablative plural, many have held diverse views,** especially when it shall have been terminated in the syllable *-is*. For indeed our ancients taught us this: that no ablative case terminated in the syllable *-is* should be lengthened, except when it had been written with double *-i*, as *radiis*, *copiis*, *gaudiis*, *brachiis*, *gladiis*, *gobiis*, and the rest; but *scolis*, *stolis*, *globis*, *modis*, *uerbis*, *donis*, *populis*, and the rest—they held that all words of this sort ought always to be shortened in the ablative. But with new schools supervening, another opinion supervened. For our people say that every dative and ablative plural case terminated in the syllable *-is* is always long by nature. What therefore shall we do, and what distinction shall we establish between that ablative plural which is necessarily lengthened through double *-i*, and that which metricians affirm to be long by nature? Let us establish this rule: that every dative and ablative plural case which is terminated in the syllable *-is*, if in the nominative case *-i* shall have been lengthened before the final syllable—as *filius*, *gladius*, *gobius*, *filia*, *gloria*, *sapientia*—the ablative or dative plural case should always have double *-i* and should be pronounced lengthened: *filiis*, *gladiis*, *gobiis*, *sapientiis*, *gloriis*, *brachiis*, *gaudiis*, *colludiis*. But if the nominative case shall not have had *-i* before the final syllable and the ablative or dative case shall have been terminated in *-is*, we will lengthen these plural cases not with two *-i*'s, but only with a mark or with sound alone and accent, in this manner: *bracis*, *globis*, *caluis*, *machiris*, *machinis*, *donis*, *tabernaculis*, and so forth.

**Now concerning the accusative case.** It seems to me that the accusative case has something of a certain preeminent firmness among the other cases, just as among the other significations of verbs the active verb does: whence some of the ancients were establishing that the accusative case ought by no means to be taken with the active verb except from the masculine gender. The solution of this question will be this: the masculine gender is said to be everything that is firm—whence also strong women are called *uiragines* [heroines]. Whence also Rithea, wife of King Ninus, used to say to her clients: "Do not call me a woman, because I am a man." But we say this so that we may know what the accusative is from the masculine gender. This is the accusative case: that which is not Greek but Latin, not doubtful but strong and stable. For indeed the Greek accusative is so uncertain and so obscure that whether it is an accusative or another case cannot easily be recognized except through the agent verb: whence many of our people have wished to wrest the Latin rule for use in Greek. The rule of the Latin accusative case will be this: that whenever it shall have been terminated in *-m* (on account of that accusative which we have often spoken of in common speech, that is, of that noun which shall have had lengthened *-e* and is monosyllabic, as *spes spei spei spem*, *res rei rei rem*, and so forth)—except, I say, for these, it must necessarily be shortened; but when ending in *-os*, except if it shall have had *-i* before, it should be lengthened.

But since so many have treated not only about the accusative case but about all cases in the measurement of meters, I, tending toward the end of this letter, will attempt in some way to ventilate a question which some have passed over as not easy—as difficult and obscure. I wonder therefore how *caelum* is now declined as neuter in the singular number and masculine in the plural in the schools of the Latins, when the ancients neither had this in use nor heard of it at all. For that which has been obtained by custom alone cannot be defended by any reason; but this practice now prevails in nearly the whole world, that with the reasons of truth abandoned, custom alone is held as true. But lest you make too long a foundation of discourse, *caelum* among the ancients signified as neuter the mass of clouds which is accustomed to hide the sun, moon, and stars, and it has in the plural number *caela*, as Sufphonia the Hebrew writes: "*tenebrosa caelant caela caeli claraque consurgunt sidera*" ["dark heavens hide the bright heavens and the bright stars rise up"]. But the highest heavens will have in the singular nominative *caelus* in the masculine gender; just as our Cicero also sings: "*caelus ille eleuatus uisu carnalium caret*" ["that heaven, elevated, lacks the sight of carnal beings"]. This *caelus*, because it is derived from *celsitudo* [height], will be worthy of aspiration; but *celum*, which is said from *celare* [to hide], cannot have the dignity of a diphthong. Every noun therefore will possess one gender always and will never pass from one to another. Finally, they also err in this: that *sibilus sibila*, *tartarus tartara* can be said in a double and, so to speak, doubtful gender—so most of our people think. For *sibilus* will be of the air or of a serpent or of leaves, and it has in the plural number *sibili sibilorum*, and all the remaining cases. But *sibilum* as neuter is to be said of a human being, which is content with only a threefold case, *sibila sibila sibila*, the rest never having been in use. Thus also when *tartarus* is said, every place generally rough and difficult of approach will be called *tartari* in the masculine plural, and the remaining cases in the customary manner; but *tartarum* as neuter, which belongs to the underworld alone, has in the plural number *tartara tartara tartara*, the rest not yet accepted. But with this ending the letter must be closed.

## Translator's Notes

### The Addressee and Context

The *Epistolae* are addressed to Julius Germanus the deacon, a figure who appears in the *Praefatio* but whose historicity remains uncertain. Vivien Law (1995) has argued that such addressees in Virgilius's works serve a literary rather than historical function, much like the interlocutors in classical dialogues. The elaborate preface preceding this chapter presents Julius as a great scholar who has sent Virgilius difficult grammatical questions—a conventional *captatio benevolentiae* typical of late antique epistolography.

### *Cassus* vs. *Casus*

Throughout the *Epistolae*, Virgilius consistently uses *cassus* for the standard Latin *casus* (grammatical case). This is one of his most distinctive orthographic features. Scholars have debated whether this represents a genuine phonetic development in Virgilius's Latin dialect, a deliberate archaism or learned affectation, or part of his broader program of linguistic variation. Löfstedt (1981) has catalogued such variant spellings as evidence for the late and Insular Latin of Virgilius's milieu. The form *cassus* also exists as a Latin adjective meaning "empty" or "vain" (cf. *in cassum*, "in vain"), which may represent a deliberate pun.

### The Schools of Terrentius and Galbungus

These two "schools" (*scolae*) are central to Virgilius's invented geography of grammatical learning. Galbungus appears frequently throughout both the *Epitomae* and *Epistolae* as one of Virgilius's primary authorities; according to the *Epitomae*, Virgilius was his student. The name has prompted various etymological suggestions—Germanic *Gal-* plus *-bungus* (Herren 1979), or perhaps a corruption of a Celtic name. Terrentius may be a variant of Terentius, perhaps evoking the comic playwright, though Virgilius's Terrentius functions purely as a grammarian.

The debate over whether the nominative ends in three or six syllables is a typical Virgilian parody of real grammatical controversies. Classical grammarians did discuss nominative endings, but Virgilius transforms a technical question into an institutional rivalry spanning "all of Europe"—an ironic touch, since such pan-European grammatical "schools" did not exist in late antiquity.

### Gender and the Ancients

Virgilius's claim that the ancients used neuter gender for all inanimate objects (*hoc lapis*, *hoc arbor*, *hoc manus*, etc.) is grammatically nonsensical in classical Latin, where these words have fixed genders. This passage has been read as parody—Virgilius mocking the grammatical tradition's appeals to the authority of the *ueteres* by inventing an absurd ancient practice. Alternatively, Vivien Law (1995) suggests Virgilius may be making a serious point about the arbitrariness of grammatical gender, which has no necessary connection to biological sex or natural properties. The advice to the addressee not to "criticize" (*reprehendere*) what the ancients did, even if it seems wrong, may be ironic commentary on the problem of authority in grammatical tradition.

### Semantic Differentiation of Doublet Forms

The distinctions Virgilius draws between alternate forms like *sepes/seps*, *preces/prex*, *sedes/ses* are characteristic of his approach. While Latin did have such doublet nominatives in some paradigms, Virgilius's semantic distinctions are his own invention:

- *sepes* = stone hedge; *seps* = wooden hedge
- *preces* = shameless demands; *prex* = proper prayer
- *sedes* = ordinary seat; *ses* = throne (from pseudo-Greek *thors* = "king")

This technique parallels the genuine grammatical tradition of *differentiae* (distinctions between similar words), but Virgilius pushes it to absurd extremes.

### The Word *Fonum*

Virgilius's use of *fonum* (appearing here as *foni* in the genitive) is one of his most distinctive technical terms. In the *Epitomae*, he distinguishes *fonum* (word as physical sound) from *uerbum* (word as semantic unit). This distinction has been compared to the Saussurean *signifiant/signifié* and to similar concepts in early Irish grammatical thought (Ó Cróinín 1989). Here the term appears in the phrase "extension of sound" (*foni extensio*), referring to pronunciation.

### The Nocturnal Visitor: Mitterius Spaniensis

The anecdote of Mitterius the Spaniard arriving at night is characteristic of Virgilius's narrative technique. Similar stories appear throughout his works: elderly, exotic grammarians visiting at strange hours, engaging in cryptic dialogues, and delivering oracular pronouncements. Herren (1995) has connected such narratives to the *Noctes Atticae* of Aulus Gellius, suggesting Virgilius was consciously imitating that work's anecdotal structure.

The descriptor "Spaniensis" (Spanish) has been taken as evidence for Iberian connections in Virgilius's milieu, though it could equally be a literary flourish lending exotic authority to an invented figure. Bischoff (1988) noted possible Visigothic or Sephardic Jewish connections.

### Invented Verbs

Perhaps the most striking feature of this chapter is Virgilius's invention of verbs homophonous with common pronouns:

- *ego* = "I live" (*ego egis egi*, from the pronoun *ego* "I")
- *tuo* = "I see clearly" (*tuo tuis tuit*, from *tuus* "your")
- *tibio* = "I play the lyre" (from *tibi* "to you" + *tibia* "flute/shin-bone")

These inventions serve multiple purposes: they demonstrate Virgilius's playful approach to language, they illustrate potential ambiguities for students, and they parody the grammatical tradition's concern with homonyms. The verb *ego* meaning "I live" is particularly audacious—an auto-referential word that collapses subject and predicate.

### Cicero, but Not the Arpinate

The "Cicero" cited here is explicitly not the famous orator from Arpinum. Virgilius elsewhere states that there were multiple Ciceros, and his Cicero writes in a distinctly un-Ciceronian style. The invented quotation "*suate uiri fratres, ut paci sint Romanae*" uses the unattested imperative *suate* (from a verb *suo* = "persuade," invented from the pronoun *sua*). The saying that "he has not read who has not read Cicero" (*non legit qui non legit Ciceronem*) is a Virgilian proverb of uncertain meaning—probably parodic.

### The Noun *Sua* = "House/Hall"

Virgilius's claim that *sua* (normally a possessive pronoun) can be a feminine noun meaning "house" (*domus*) where scholars compose their works is entirely invented. This exemplifies his technique of finding hidden meanings in common words. The description of scholarly composition in a *sua* may reflect the setting of monastic scriptoria.

### *Caelum/Caelus* and Gender Instability

The discussion of *caelum* (heaven/sky) takes a genuine grammatical peculiarity—the word is neuter singular but *caeli* appears as masculine plural in classical poetry—and spins it into an elaborate theory of two distinct words:

- *caelum* (neuter) = cloud-cover, from *celare* (to hide)
- *caelus* (masculine) = the highest heaven, from *celsitudo* (height)

The Hebrew authority "Sufphonia" and the Virgilian hexameter attributed to him appear nowhere else. The name may derive from Hebrew *tsopheh* (watchman/seer) or the biblical Zephaniah.

### The Problem of Interpretation

This chapter illustrates the fundamental hermeneutic problem Virgilius poses. Current scholarship (Law 1995, Di Maggio 2021) tends to see him as neither a charlatan who misunderstands real grammar, nor a simple parodist mocking grammatical learning, but rather a creative writer and perhaps esoteric teacher using the grammar genre for literary experimentation. The *Epistolae* show too much genuine grammatical knowledge to be mere ignorance, too much structural sophistication to be simple mockery. Virgilius seems to be exploring the limits of language, authority, and meaning through the unlikely vehicle of a grammatical treatise.

### A Note on This Translation

I have tried to preserve the somewhat meandering quality of Virgilius's prose, including his tendency to digress and then apologize for digressing. Technical terms have generally been rendered as literally as possible, with the Latin preserved in italics where the term is essential to the discussion. Passages where the Latin is genuinely ambiguous or corrupt have been rendered according to the most probable sense, following Huemer's and Löfstedt's texts.

The chapter divisions and bold section headings are editorial additions for readability; the Latin text flows continuously.
