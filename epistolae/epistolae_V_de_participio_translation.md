# THE LETTERS OF VIRGILIUS MARO
## V. ON THE PARTICIPLE

### English Translation

As I am about to speak concerning the participle, about which frequent discourse has been made both by us and by most teachers, I think that saying of my Aeneas should be recalled in the preface of the work. For it is best and very best indeed for every student to make unfailing mention of his teacher at the end of all writings and at the beginning, whom they call the third father of human learning. And so my Aeneas asserts that the virtue of participles is threefold, which he set forth in such manner in his book written and methodically arranged concerning the virtue of all the arts: "The first virtue of participles," he says, "is that it possesses the noun and verb, the two principal parts of speech. The second, that just as the verb is active, in the same manner it also acts. The third, that if it is placed at the end of testimonies, it is taken for a verb; which however happens not by constant custom but rarely." Thus Aeneas.

It must be known first of all that the whole participle through all six cases is accustomed to perform double duty, at least with that verb of whose signification it is acting. The nominative case of a participle in one instance and the ablative are often placed for one another. Whether this is correct or otherwise, let us leave to the judgment of those who so write. For we often find the ablative participial placed for the nominative, according to that saying of Glengus: "*Hoste per portas rumpente ciues uacillauerunt*" [With the enemy breaking through the gates, the citizens wavered]. Concerning this, however, opinion varies very greatly, with some thinking that a seventh case is taken from both nouns, but others asserting according to Galbungus's tradition that this case ought rather to be understood as an eighth of both nouns. Which Aeneas also approves, whence also writing to me he declined a certain noun thus: *proson*, *prosonis*, *prosoni*, *prosonem*. And when he came to the ablative, he wrote that same case three times.

When I inquired the reason for this, he thus resolved it saying: "The sixth case, which is the ablative, and the seventh and eighth are similar in the form of letters, unless they differ in expression and quality of meaning. But if they are distinguished by expression, in the ablative case '*ab hoc prosone bene clamatum est*' [by this proson it was well proclaimed]; in the seventh case '*hoc prosone clamatorie fruuntur*' [they enjoy this proson in oratorical fashion]; whence those are to be reproved who say '*fruuntur ab eo*' or '*eum*' or '*eius*,' for a verb of this kind, *fruor* [I enjoy], just as also certain similar ones, ought to be joined to no other case except the seventh alone. But in the eighth case '*hoc prosone declamante*' [with this proson declaiming], for which case, as we said, the nominative is often placed in reading, on account of this necessity I think, that in the same expression another nominative case is joined personally to the principal verb, which speaks first." Just as we read in the verse of Bregandus Lugenicus: "*Solus Cato miles, populus turbatus, in acie stetit*" [Cato the soldier alone, the people being disturbed, stood in the battle line]. As if he had said: "alone with the people disturbed he stood." Which many utterly not understanding, added the verb *est*, which absolutely cannot happen without a causal conjunction. For if in hyperbatic fashion mixed in the middle of the expression he had placed another order, as we not rarely read, the excellent teacher would have produced it thus: "*Solus miles, turbatus enim populus est, in acie stetit*" [The soldier alone, for the people was disturbed, stood in the battle line].

But now let us opportunely return to the exposition of the participle, from which we have nearly departed. The participle is a common part of speech, which is defined and supported by genders and significations. But the participle of present time is defined to be of a noun of every gender, ⟨...⟩ they are brought forth in their proper genders. Certain people say that some participles are begotten from verbs and nouns as if by a certain marriage. Whence both the noun of the first position and the participle itself have the same nominative, as *sensus* [sense/having been sensed], *gressus* [step/having stepped], *uersus* [line/having been turned], *intellectus* [understanding/having been understood], *quaestus* [gain/having been sought], *cultus* [cultivation/having been cultivated], *planctus* [lamentation/having been lamented] and so forth. For this participle *sensus* is rightly taken from the passive verb, which is *sentior* [I am sensed]: for thus it is declined in the past tense, *sensus sum*, *sensus es*, *sensus est*. There is also a noun which is declined thus: *sensus*, *sensui*. Nevertheless because this noun *sensus* is born from a verb, therefore the participle must be believed to come not from this noun but from the verb.

But in declension the similarity is distinguished, for the declension of the noun is this: *sensus*, *sensus*; but of the participle *sensus*, *sensi*, *senso* and so forth. But *uersus* is not accepted by some in the principal noun, but in the participle: there however they write *uersum*, because *uors* itself is called a page, as Lucan says: "*Uortibus egebunt multis*" [They will need many pages]. But to me it seems that *uersus* of a page also written should not be rejected, because when writing a page you have made a line extending from the beginning along its length all the way to the margin, you will necessarily turn your hand back again to the head of what has been written. The same custom is shown to be observed also in reading, likewise by the very sight of the eyes. The participle of the present tense must be believed to suit every gender, just as also every person. The numbers of participles and figures are born from both.

Truly we would believe these things to suffice concerning participles, except that a certain question presses upon teachers, such that they think that all participles of every tense should be placed for verbs, as Ossius and Perrichius and Galbarius and the rest of the Latins presume. For Galbarius in a certain immense volume, which he had composed concerning commentaries on the created world, abundant indeed but eloquent, had taken almost all participles for verbs. In the beginning indeed saying: "*Contuebilis mundus ab incontuebili potestate creatus, sole et luna omnibus etiam astris uaria pictura splendentibus ornatus, nascituris in eo mortalibus sensus loculentissimi conlaturus adapertionem, et in omnium fine resoluendus aut etiam reformandus*" [The visible world created by an invisible power, adorned with the sun and moon and all stars shining with varied painting, about to confer upon mortals to be born in it the opening of most abundant sense, and at the end of all things to be dissolved or even reformed]. You see the whole texture of this work directed through participles placed in the position of verbs. And this ancient custom held strength through many provinces of Africa and Europe, that participles are accustomed to be taken for verbs. But we, to whom this manner of writing was not handed down by our teachers, that we should be accustomed to read or write something other than verbs, let us inquire whether any of the ancient fathers, to contradict whose teachings is the greatest impiety, ever took a participle for a verb or taught that it should be taken. Which if we should find, it is our intention to imitate as well, although we remember having forbidden that a verb can be made from a participle; nevertheless we will change our definition.

But whether the participle receives the degrees of comparison according to the rules of nouns must be more diligently investigated. For many think that a participle cannot be compared at all, whom the amplitude of authentic reading rejects. It remains therefore that we hold that rule which we established for taking adverbs from participles, also for the degrees of participles to be rightly compared. The participle of the present tense of a neutral verb is undoubtedly compared in these degrees: for you say *audens audentior audentissimus* [daring, more daring, most daring], *instans instantior instantissimus* [pressing, more pressing, most pressing], *fidens fidentior fidentissimus* [trusting, more trusting, most trusting], *egens egentior egentissimus* [needing, more needing, most needing]. So also that participle of a passive verb of past time, when you say *doctus doctior doctissimus* [taught, more taught, most taught], *paratus paratior paratissimus* [prepared, more prepared, most prepared], *laudatus laudatior laudatissimus* [praised, more praised, most praised].

But if anyone should wish to object to us saying that the participle of an active verb of past time has degrees of comparison, and to say that whenever these participles have been compared, which we are about to set forth below, such as *sapiens* [wise] and *amans* [loving], because these are rightly compared, they ought rather to be reckoned nouns similar to participles, he does not seem to me to be refuted or even disapproved. Let him also not disapprove of us, who steadfastly defend and assert what we have learned from our skilled teachers. Let Maevius, a man most sweet in his songs, support me in this, about whom that saying was sung: "*Qui fauum mellis non amat, odit tua carmina, Maeui*" [Who does not love the honeycomb, hates your songs, Maevius]. He produced a most eloquent poem on the eight parts of speech, in which he says this: "*Participium generis omnis omne tam ex uerbo quam etiam ex nomine comparatiuum rectogradum trahit iure: sed et superlatiuum eodem receptat more*" [Every participle of every gender draws the comparative in the direct degree rightly both from the verb and also from the noun: but it also receives the superlative in the same manner]. In which he shows that every gender not only of appellative nouns, but also of verbs is compared in these aforesaid degrees.

There are also participles whose verbs are not so much in use, and therefore they are denied to be participles, but are reckoned to be nouns similar to participles, as *togatus* [toga-wearing], *tunicatus* [tunic-wearing], *mitratus* [mitre-wearing], *calciatus* [shoe-wearing], *gladiatus* [sword-bearing], *hastatus* [spear-bearing], *scutatus* [shield-bearing]. But if it is so, according to this reasoning let us also say that these are thus: *praecinctus* [girt], *uestitus* [clothed], *amictus* [wrapped]; whose verbs nevertheless are available to every reader in most ready and most frequent use. And how will that saying of Aeneas stand? "The soldiers," he says, "*tunicantur*" [are being tunicked]. And again, "*Quis gladiabitur in bello?*" [Who will be sworded in battle?] Horatius also says: "*Magno impetu facto hastauerunt se omnes et calciauerunt et scutantes se inruerunt*" [With a great attack made, they all speared themselves and shoed themselves and shielding themselves rushed in]. You see indeed how these active verbs are found, and not only simply active, but also triply: for the sense of the reading manifestly shows that these verbs act twice according to the active signification and a third time according to the passive. For you say "*hastauit se hasta*" [he speared himself with a spear] and "*hastatus est hasta*" [he was speared with a spear]. This can also be taken without hesitation concerning every verb which holds the efficacy of adorning or un-adorning, as *orno* [I adorn], *corono* [I crown], *calcio* [I shoe], *uestio* [I clothe], *amicio* [I wrap], *cingo* [I gird], *tunico* [I tunic], *hasto* [I spear], *gladio* [I sword], *mitro* [I mitre], *armo* [I arm], *spolio* [I despoil], *nudo* [I strip], *amicio* [I wrap], *fraudo* [I defraud]. So also according to the adornment of the soul, as *doceo* [I teach], *erudio* [I instruct], *inbuo* [I imbue], *instruo* [I train], *informo* [I form].

But indeed an opportune end of this letter would be at hand; but a question which is very difficult to resolve compels the speech to proceed a little further. For indeed when it is not doubted that three participles come from a deponent verb, there is a deponent verb from which four participles seem to be drawn, as *orior* [I arise], from which is *oriens* [arising], *oriturus* [about to arise], *ortus* [having arisen], *oriundus* [to be arisen from]. It is asked therefore in what manner we ought to use this reasoning, when there is no passive verb from which it might be drawn. *Oriundus* seems to some not to be a participle, but a noun similar to a participle of future time, as *furibundus* [raging], *laetabundus* [rejoicing], *gaudibundus* [exulting], *natabundus* [swimming]. But this opinion does not seem to me to be fitting, for no one doubts that *oriundus* is a participle. But asking Galbungus about this and Aeneas at the same time, I heard from them jointly that this participle, like also *ortus*, is of past time; whence also in the enumeration of participles, with a disjunctive conjunction interposed, thus we say *oriens oriturus ortus uel oriundus* [arising, about to arise, having arisen or being arisen from]: from which we show that these two participles are of one tense, and therefore we rightly write "*oriundus erat*" [he was arisen from], not "*erit*" [he will be].

But with this question resolved, another question arises in the same participle: why do we not write *oriendus*, when there is *oriens*? Those who have prudently learned to write verbs preserve distinction in all things, in moods and persons. For thus it is declined: *orior oriris oritur orimur orimini oriuntur*. So also in every verb of the third conjugation, whether of the long or also of the short type, *u* is always taken in the third person of the plural number, as *audiunt*, *legunt*, *metiuntur*. This is because if *e* is written, future tense is thought. Yet it seems strange to me why it is not thus written *oriendus* with *e*: perhaps lest it be thought to be a passive verb, as *legendus*. Again I ask, when *oriundus* is written, why also in the participle of present time it is not thus written *oriens oriuntus*. This is not customary, except in the participles of verbs of the fourth conjugation, where instead of *i* and *e* in the nominative case, in the remaining cases with *i* removed, *e* and *u* are placed, as is *iens euntis*, so *quiens queuntis*, *transiens transeuntis* and so forth.

Another question presses upon us, quite in need of resolution: why we often find written *standum* [to be stood], *sedendum* [to be sat], *audendum* [to be dared], *loquendum* [to be spoken], when from a neutral verb no more than two participles are accustomed to come, and from a deponent only three are drawn. But this seems to imitate a participle of a passive verb, when you say *gaudendum* [to be rejoiced] or *meditandum* [to be meditated]. But this is to be referred to impersonal verbs, whose participles are these which we mentioned above. There are also participles which are thought to be defective in tenses, which is very strange, when the verbs themselves are not defective. Therefore we ought not to believe that participles can be defective when the verbs are still fully available. But such participles are these: *studens* [studying], for the participle here of future time is denied by most to exist, so that *studiturus* [about to study] is not said; which I do not know how wrongly is thought, unless perhaps because the past tense in the indicative mood of this verb is believed not to occur; which is utterly unfitting, because we often read *studui* [I studied]. There is also another participle of future time which is thought to be able to be found with all others rejected, as *urguendus* [to be urged], as if *urguens* [urging] cannot be read; which because we read most frequently, needs no examples. So also *urgiturus* [about to urge] and *urgitus* [having been urged]. They also say that *coeptus* [begun] is a defective participle: we are compelled to assent to them in this, because *incipio* [I begin] is a neutral verb. But perhaps you say, because *capio* [I take] is active, from which comes *coeptus*. It is not so, for from this verb according to the passive signification comes not *coeptus* but *captus* [taken].

Wondering therefore how a participle of a passive verb can come from a neutral verb, I remember having asked Aeneas about this, and thus he responded to me: that this is not a participle, but an adjective noun similar to a participle. This is Aeneas's judgment concerning this participle. When therefore I had heard him saying definitively that from defective verbs there must always be defective participles, I asked him saying: "How then, my lord, do we find a participle being born from that verb which is defective in persons, as is *decens* [fitting] from *decet* [it befits]?" Then smiling at me he said: "I advise you, my son, not to be led astray by any similarity: for many indeed not understanding the force of Latin speech, led by similarity, place parts for parts, just as also that which we are often accustomed to read *inpraesentiarum* [for the present] they confuse and not knowing what it is, they remove the final syllable *-rum* so that they place *in praesentia*, making an ablative case with a preposition, which is utterly unfitting, for *inpraesentiarum* makes one temporal adverb, so that it is similar to *praesentim* as it were: and in this way they are led astray, because they falsely think *decens* is a participle. For these verbs which are defective according to persons, such as *decet* [it befits], *oportet* [it behooves], *tedet* [it wearies] and so forth, have no participles. It remains therefore that you understand *decens* to be an adjective noun, similar indeed to a participle, just as also *condecens* [very fitting] and *indecens* [unfitting] and *perdecens* [thoroughly fitting]." Thus Aeneas.

But since I think I have sufficiently discussed the participle both in this and in the above-mentioned work, I shall give an opportune end to this letter.

## Translator's Notes

### The Teacher as Third Father

The opening tribute to one's teacher as a "third father" (*tertium patrem*) of human learning—after the biological father and, presumably, the spiritual father (God or perhaps one's baptismal sponsor)—reflects the reverence for pedagogical lineage characteristic of late antique and early medieval learning. The emphasis on mentioning one's teacher at both the beginning and end of writings (*in fine omnium scriptorum atque initio*) establishes a frame of pious attribution that Virgilius both observes and parodies throughout his work.

### Aeneas's Three Virtues

The three *uirtutes* of the participle that Aeneas enumerates reflect genuine grammatical understanding dressed in Virgilian terminology. The first virtue—that participles partake of both noun and verb—is the standard ancient definition (hence *participium*, "sharing"). The second—that participles inherit verbal action—captures their ability to govern objects. The third—that participles can substitute for finite verbs at sentence end—describes the ablative absolute and related constructions, though Virgilius's claim that this is rare (*raro*) understates its frequency in classical Latin.

### The Seventh and Eighth Cases

The claim that Latin has eight cases rather than six is one of Virgilius's most striking grammatical innovations. While Greek had five cases and Latin six (adding the ablative), Virgilius posits a seventh case for the object of verbs like *fruor* (which takes the ablative in classical grammar) and an eighth for the ablative absolute construction. This analysis, attributed to Galbungus and confirmed by Aeneas, reflects genuine insight into the multiple functions of the ablative case, even if the solution—multiplying cases—is idiosyncratic. The invented noun *proson* (perhaps from Greek *prosōpon*, "face" or "person") serves as an abstract demonstration noun, like the grammarians' *mensa* but more mysterious.

### Bregandus Lugenicus

This figure, cited for a verse showing nominative-ablative interchange, appears nowhere else in Latin literature. The name *Lugenicus* may suggest Irish *Lug* or *Luigne*, supporting theories of Virgilius's Insular connections. The verse itself—"*Solus Cato miles, populus turbatus, in acie stetit*"—is metrically awkward, which may be intentional. The invocation of "Cato" evokes Roman republican virtue, though which Cato (if any historical figure) is meant remains unclear.

### Participles as Verbs: Galbarius's Cosmology

The extended quotation from Galbarius's commentary "on the created world" (*de commentariis creati seculi*) is remarkable for its content as much as its style. The passage describes creation entirely through participles: *creatus* (created), *ornatus* (adorned), *conlaturus* (about to confer), *resoluendus* (to be dissolved), *reformandus* (to be reformed). This technique, which Virgilius reports as common "through many provinces of Africa and Europe," may reflect actual late Latin stylistic tendencies—late antique Christian prose does show increasing use of participial constructions. The theological content (visible world created by invisible power, to be dissolved or reformed at the end) is orthodox Christian cosmology.

### Maevius the Poet

The Maevius praised here ("*Qui fauum mellis non amat, odit tua carmina, Maeui*"—Who does not love the honeycomb hates your songs, Maevius) stands in striking contrast to the Maevius mocked by Virgil and Horace as a bad poet. Either Virgilius is rehabilitating a maligned figure, inventing a different Maevius entirely, or deliberately inverting classical literary judgment. The quotation from Maevius's poem on the eight parts of speech, with its technical term *rectogradum* (direct degree, i.e., positive before comparative), suggests genuine grammatical content beneath the playful attribution.

### Denominative Verbs

The discussion of whether words like *togatus*, *hastatus*, and *scutatus* are true participles or merely participial adjectives engages a real grammatical question. Virgilius's solution—to posit underlying verbs *togo*, *hasto*, *scuto*, etc.—is creative if unclassical. The quotations from Aeneas ("*milites tunicantur*") and Horatius ("*hastauerunt se omnes et calciauerunt*") demonstrate these invented verbs in action. The observation that such verbs can operate "triply" (*tripliciter*)—actively with reflexive, actively without, and passively—shows sophisticated analysis of voice and valency.

### Verbs of Adornment

The list of "adorning and un-adorning" verbs (*orno*, *corono*, *calcio*, *uestio*, *amicio*, *cingo*, *tunico*, *hasto*, *gladio*, *mitro*, *armo*, *spolio*, *nudo*, *fraudo*) and verbs of mental adornment (*doceo*, *erudio*, *inbuo*, *instruo*, *informo*) reveals an underlying semantic theory. Virgilius sees a class of verbs defined by their function of adding or removing attributes—whether physical garments and weapons or intellectual qualities. This semantic categorization cuts across the usual grammatical classifications.

### The Four Participles of *Orior*

The problem of *oriundus* is genuine: classical grammarians debated whether it was a true participle or an adjective. Virgilius's solution—that *oriundus* and *ortus* are both past participles, distinguished only by a disjunctive conjunction (*ortus uel oriundus*)—is creative if unconvincing. The observation that we say "*oriundus erat*" not "*oriundus erit*" correctly identifies the past-referring semantics of the form.

### The Adverb *Inpraesentiarum*

Aeneas's digression on *inpraesentiarum* (for the present, at this time) illustrates Virgilius's concern with linguistic confusion. The form is indeed a frozen genitive plural that functions as an adverb, and Aeneas correctly criticizes those who analyze it as a preposition plus ablative (*in praesentia*). This kind of synchronic folk etymology, reanalyzing opaque forms according to productive patterns, is a real phenomenon that grammarians properly resist.

### Impersonal Verbs and *Decens*

The final exchange between Virgilius and Aeneas concerns whether *decens* (fitting, seemly) is a participle of the impersonal verb *decet* (it befits). Aeneas's answer—that impersonal verbs have no participles, so *decens* must be an adjective—reflects standard grammatical teaching. The related forms *condecens*, *indecens*, and *perdecens* (the last probably invented) are offered as further evidence of adjectival rather than participial status.

### The Lacuna

The text contains an apparent lacuna after "the participle of present time is defined to be of a noun of every gender" (*sed participium temporis praesentis ex nomine omnis generis esse diffinitur*), marked in the translation with ⟨...⟩. Huemer's apparatus notes that words seem to have fallen out here. The surviving text resumes with "they are brought forth in their proper genders," leaving the intervening argument unclear.

### Structure of the Chapter

This chapter is notably longer and more digressive than the previous one on adverbs, with multiple questions raised, seemingly resolved, then reopened. The pattern of consulting authorities (Aeneas, Galbungus, Glengus, Maevius, Horatius, Bregandus), receiving answers, then asking follow-up questions creates a dialogic texture unusual in grammatical treatises. The repeated phrases about ending the letter (*oportunus finis inmineret*, *oportunum finem dabo*) followed by further discussion may parody the conventions of epistolary closure.
