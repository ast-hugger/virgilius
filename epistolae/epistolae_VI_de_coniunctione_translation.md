# VI. ON THE CONJUNCTION

It seems to me, dearest son, that this part of speech which is called the conjunction is similar to certain joints or fastenings, by which whatever structures are to be bound are tied together, especially those of wooden frameworks. For in such a manner this particle conjoins and glues together words and sentences. The ancients enumerated its power as divided into five species, of which the first is the copulative, which properly speaking conjoins. Among copulative conjunctions, which are six in number—*et*, *ac*, *at*, *atque*, *ast*—the Greek *ce* is also taken up: for *ἔξτρεμε* among the Greeks is always placed for *et*. And this copulative is accustomed to be made of the subjunctive order among us at least: but in its own proper language it is often placed before. But by us it is applied subjunctively to the demonstrative or relative pronoun, which are monosyllabic, through the addition of that syllable as I think, as if you say *hicce*, *haecce*, *hocce*, *isce*, *eace*, *idce*. But it can also be subjoined to all cases of the aforementioned pronouns. But perhaps you say that the relative pronoun of feminine gender *ea* is not of one syllable, but of two; it is true indeed that *ea* is two syllables, but then this happens when any consonant follows the last vowel, as *eam*, *eas*, *eos* and so forth, so that one long letter weighed against two short ones, each makes a syllable; for two vowels alone can be reduced into one syllable: whence because *ea* is one syllable, it will not have been necessary for us to add *ce*. But *et* indeed consists of two letters *e* and *t*, but in conjunction they are written with one stroke and are spoken under one utterance. But in the verb of the third person, not *&*, but *et* ought to be written, as *uacet*, *sulcet*. They also err who write the aspirate *h* in the copulative *ac*, which is to be held in the pronoun alone, which receives this same letter through all cases, as *haec*, *huius*, *huic*, *hanc*, *ab hac*.

It must certainly be known that in conjunctions the power is often changed, according to the quality of sentences and the reasoning of meanings. For *ast* and *at* are often called not copulative conjunctions but expletive, or as we better say, discretive: for they do not so much conjoin sentences as distinguish them. For I do not know how we should call expletive those which both change meanings and persons and make them differ. But these are the discretive conjunctions: *at*, *ast*, *sane*, *uero*, *porro*, *autem*, *ceterum*. There are also other conjunctions which join sentences, and which although they are said to be taken for causal or rational, if the truth of the name is inquired according to the quality of meaning, they should more rightly be called completive. But what are the completive conjunctions? *Cum*, *dum*, *nam*, *namque*, *quia*, *quoniam*, *etenim*, *enim* and so forth.

But it is to be wondered at, indeed to be wept over and lamented with all feeling, that while the other parts of speech, so especially conjunctions have been confused and thrown about, to such an extent that between causal and rational there is almost no difference. I shall spare my Donatus, who most greatly confuses this part of speech, which his brother Don most rightly criticized, who most rightly repeated: there are iterative conjunctions, which repeat the same sense and the same sentence; which are: *item*, *itemque*, *itidem*, *idemtidem*, *tantundem*, *rursum*, *denuo*, *iterum*. There are nevertheless among the African writers those who affirm that these are rather adverbs of repeating.

But causal conjunctions are those which have the cause of retracting and in some way destroying a sentence; which are: *si*, *nisi*, *nisitamen*, *uerum*, *saltimne*, *sed*, *donec*, *usquequo*, *quoadusque*, *usquedum*, *quatinus*, *quamdiu*, *quamuis*, *quamquam*, *quamlibet*, *siquidem* and so forth. But rational conjunctions are those which require from the preceding sentence the reason for the following; which are: *ergo*, *ideo*, *idcirco*, *itaque*, *propterea*, *epita*, *igitur*, *ceros*, *quamobrem*, *proinde*, *prohoc*, *quapropter*, *propterquod* and so forth. There are also certain assimilative conjunctions; they are so called because they correspond to words of likeness, as *sic*, *ita*, *perinde*. There are also participial ones, which are called both adverbs and conjunctions in a common manner, as *paulatim*, *utique*, *etiam*, *equidem*, *interea*, *praeterea*. For we say *interea* as a rational conjunction for *ergo*. We also say *interea* as an adverb of time for *tunc*. We also say it as an adverb of place like *ubi*. Then also it is shortened by the very accent of the word. There are also revelatory conjunctions, which reveal the meaning, as *scilicet*, *uidelicet*, *illicet*.

We ought to know this also, that all conjunctions are either prepositive or subjunctive or common. There are also those which are of no order. The prepositive are: *et*, *at*, *si*, *quoniam*, *ac*, *atque*, *porro*, *ceterum*, *ceros*. The subjunctive: *autem*, *uero*, *-que*, *scilicet* and so forth. The common: *ergo*, *ideo*, *itaque*, *idcirco*, *perhoc*, *proinde*, *epita*, *igitur*, *-que*. Those of no order are: *iterum*, *paulatim*, *saltim*, for they pertain not to the order of the expression, but to the quality of meaning.

I could indeed treat of the conjunction somewhat more broadly, but because it has often been written both by us and by many, therefore having set down one expression which is to be judged useful for readers, we shall leave the rest untouched. If two conjunctions have been placed in one expression, that is a completive and a rational, they will be released from each other and the reason for no other sentence will be demanded, as: *quoniam ergo*, *quia igitur*, *ideo quia*, *unde quoniam*, *quoniam idcirco* and so forth. With these things said, an end must be placed on the letter.

## Translator's Notes

### The Carpentry Metaphor

The opening comparison of conjunctions to *incastraturae* (joints, mortises) and *nexurae* (fastenings, bindings) used in wooden construction, especially *tabulata* (plank structures, wooden frameworks, or flooring), is strikingly concrete. While late antique grammarians sometimes used architectural metaphors, Virgilius's specificity suggests familiarity with actual woodworking. The metaphor captures the conjunction's function of holding syntactic elements together, though the image of buildings rather than sentences predominates. The verb *conglutinare* (to glue together) extends the craft imagery.

### The Greek *Ce* and *Extreme*

Virgilius's claim that Greek *ἔξτρεμε* (*extreme*) is used for *et* is puzzling. No such Greek word exists with this meaning; Greek uses *καί* for "and." The form appears to be a pseudo-Greek invention, perhaps based on Latin *extremus* with a Greek ending, or a garbled transmission. The enclitic *-ce* attached to Latin pronouns (*hicce*, *haecce*, etc.) is genuine and does derive from a demonstrative particle, though its connection to Greek is Virgilius's own fabrication.

### The Ligature *&*

The discussion of *et* versus the ligature *&* (the ampersand, here written as a Tironian note) is technically interesting. Virgilius correctly notes that *&* represents two letters written "with one stroke" (*uno stilo*) and warns against using the ligature in verbal endings like *uacet* and *sulcet*, where *-et* is part of the word rather than the conjunction. This reflects real scribal practice and potential confusion in manuscripts.

### Aspirate Confusion: *Ac* versus *Hac*

The warning against writing *hac* for *ac* addresses a genuine orthographic issue. The conjunction *ac* (and) could be confused with the ablative feminine singular of *hic* (*hac*, "by/with/from this"). Virgilius's insistence that *h* belongs only to the pronoun reflects correct classical usage, though by his era aspiration was increasingly ignored in pronunciation.

### Discretive versus Expletive

Virgilius's preference for the term *discretiuae* (discretive, distinguishing) over *expletiuae* (expletive, filling out) for conjunctions like *at*, *ast*, *autem* shows genuine semantic sensitivity. These words do mark contrast and distinction rather than mere addition. His rhetorical question—"how should we call expletive those which change meanings and make them differ?"—challenges the traditional terminology.

### Donatus and Don

The reference to "my Donatus" (*Donato meo*) whom Virgilius will spare, and his brother Don who corrected him, is characteristically Virgilian. The famous grammarian Aelius Donatus (4th century) had no known brother named Don, so these are clearly figures from Virgilius's invented scholarly world. The name "Don" may be Irish (a common element in names like *Donnchad*), supporting theories of Insular composition. That Donatus "confuses" conjunctions while his brother "most rightly corrected" him inverts the usual hierarchy of famous versus obscure authorities.

### African Writers

The mention of *Afros scriptores* (African writers) who classify iterative words as adverbs rather than conjunctions continues Virgilius's pattern of geographical scholarly references. Whether this reflects actual knowledge of North African grammatical traditions or is simply local color remains uncertain. The region did produce significant grammarians, making the attribution plausible if unverifiable.

### Causal versus Rational Conjunctions

Virgilius's distinction between causal conjunctions (which "retract and destroy" sentences: *si*, *nisi*, *sed*, etc.) and rational conjunctions (which "require from the preceding the reason for the following": *ergo*, *igitur*, *ideo*, etc.) maps roughly onto modern distinctions between conditional/adversative and inferential/conclusive connectives. His lament that "between causal and rational there is almost no difference" reflects genuine overlap in usage.

### The Mysterious *Epita* and *Ceros*

Among the rational conjunctions, Virgilius lists *epita* and *ceros*, words that appear nowhere else in Latin literature. Various explanations have been proposed:

- *Epita* might derive from Greek *ἔπειτα* (then, thereupon), though the form is aberrant
- *Ceros* has no obvious etymology; it may be pure invention or a garbled transmission

These hapax legomena (words occurring only once) are characteristic of Virgilius's work and contribute to the ongoing debate about whether he is preserving otherwise lost vocabulary, inventing freely, or transmitting corrupted forms.

### Participial Conjunctions

The category of "participial" (*participes*) conjunctions—words that function as both adverbs and conjunctions—shows Virgilius grappling with genuine grammatical ambiguity. Words like *interea* and *praeterea* do have both temporal/local (adverbial) and connective (conjunctional) functions. His observation that *interea* can mean *ergo* (therefore), *tunc* (then), or *ubi* (where) depending on context, with the accent changing accordingly, reflects real functional flexibility.

### Revelatory Conjunctions

The *reuelatiuae* (revelatory) conjunctions—*scilicet*, *uidelicet*, *illicet*—are those that "reveal the meaning." These words etymologically contain forms of *licet* (it is permitted) combined with *scire* (to know), *uidere* (to see), and *ille* (that), and they do function to make explicit or clarify. The term *reuelatiuae* is Virgilius's own; standard grammars do not use this category.

### Word Order Classes

The classification of conjunctions by position—prepositive (placed before), subjunctive (placed after), common (either), and those of no fixed order—reflects genuine Latin usage. Enclitics like *-que* must follow their host word; *autem* and *uero* typically come second in their clause; *et* precedes. Virgilius's list is largely accurate, though some assignments are debatable.

### Double Conjunctions

The final technical point—that when a completive and rational conjunction appear together (*quoniam ergo*, *quia igitur*), they "release each other" and no further justification is needed—addresses a real stylistic phenomenon. Such doubled connectives are common in late Latin and can seem redundant, but Virgilius treats them as self-sufficient units.

### Brevity of the Chapter

Like the chapter on adverbs, this letter on conjunctions is relatively brief, with Virgilius explicitly noting that he could treat the topic "more broadly" but chooses not to since it has been "often written both by us and by many." This acknowledges both the *Epitomae*'s treatment of conjunctions and the extensive existing grammatical tradition. The brevity may also reflect the inherently less generative nature of the conjunction as a topic—there are fewer opportunities for the elaborate inventions and anecdotes that enliven Virgilius's discussions of nouns and verbs.
