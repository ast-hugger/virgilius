# VIII. ON THE INTERJECTION

Now let us say a few things about the interjection. The interjection is indeed a part of speech, but so unusual that unless it were because it is not enumerated by the Greeks, it would not be thought to be Latin. But in speech, which is rarely read by us, there are many interjections, and their significations are abundant:

- Of glorying, as *rassam*, *rauc*, *samia*, *sarap*
- Of rejoicing, as *euge*, *salecon*
- Of exclaiming, as *heu*, *ehunaue*
- Of hastening, as *tnax* and *cetiu*, *salum*
- Of laboring, as *faticalpin*, *eugan*
- Of wondering, as *euax*, *affario*
- Of persuading, as *quesgoor*
- Of groaning, as *tatans*
- Of mourning, of grieving, as *pappen*, *leon*

Content to say these things about the interjection, let us pass over the rest: for almost none of them is ready for us to speak, except one which we almost passed over, which is of lamenting and is to be spoken with aspiration, namely *uae*, which is so firm that it is doubted by many whether it is a noun or a verb or indeed an adverb.

It is permitted in the conclusion of my work to set forth for you the games of the philosophers; it is permitted that we put down a few, three, from the many from the speech of Aeneas. He said to me: "See, my son, let this bare stone teach you, which you see worn away by waters: thus the wise man is worn away by his waters, that is, he dwells in the world without profit from the studies of wisdom." Seeing moreover the rising sun, he said: "Behold, the horse leaps from his barrier, running across the whole field, until returning to the same stable he gives place to the mule with her foals to leap in the field of the heavens." Signifying by the mule the moon, by the foals the stars, by the barrier the sea.

Thirdly he said: "Who loves? Only he who is not loved in return."

This is the game of Galbungus: "What," you might ask, "flies across a whole hour in one instant?" The human mind flying across the whole sky in a single moment.

Let my little jests also appear to you, even the smallest in all things, which may build up the reader more than harm him:

"*Uatum personet ponticum ponto ex natum naturo naturum naturam nataturo: terni tema flumen fontes fronda ex una undatim daturi sepna semper atur aspirannis perennis rectis re perque tura toregmatis magna dei decies dena dilfensum quam possit molos minulatur atroci saeuo seu ignoro nimphae neganda. Gnaro ab ignando, gnaris ab gelandis. Leto lectisque lux oro suis solim in trono trino uno omni praesim potente deo digna regna regnaturo torii per cuncta cunctorum aeterno aeuo efandi secula.*"

## Translator's Notes

### The Interjection as Marginal

Virgilius's treatment of the interjection as the eighth and final part of speech reflects ancient grammatical tradition, which often treated interjections as problematic or marginal. His observation that interjections are "so unusual that unless it were because it is not enumerated by the Greeks, it would not be thought to be Latin" is characteristically paradoxical: the interjection is validated as Latin precisely because it shares with Greek the quality of not being properly counted among the parts of speech. Some ancient grammarians indeed subsumed interjections under adverbs.

### The Invented Interjections

As with his prepositions, Virgilius provides a list of exotic interjections, most of which appear nowhere else:

**Genuine Latin interjections**:
- *euge* (bravo!, well done!)—Greek loan
- *heu* (alas!)
- *euax* (hurrah!)—rare but attested
- *uae* (woe!)

**Apparent inventions**:
- *rassam*, *rauc*, *samia*, *sarap* (glorying)
- *salecon* (rejoicing)
- *ehunaue* (exclaiming)—possibly *eheu* + *aue* combined?
- *tnax*, *cetiu*, *salum* (hastening)
- *faticalpin*, *eugan* (laboring)
- *affario* (wondering)
- *quesgoor* (persuading)
- *tatans* (groaning)
- *pappen*, *leon* (mourning)

Some of these forms have vaguely Celtic or Greek appearances (*leon* might suggest Greek λέων "lion" or be onomatopoeic), but none can be securely derived. They may represent the same obscure "fourth Latinity" as the invented prepositions, or pure creative invention.

### The Problem of *Uae*

Virgilius's observation that *uae* is "so firm" that people debate whether it is a noun, verb, or adverb reflects genuine grammatical discussion. The word appears in constructions like *uae tibi* (woe to you) and *uae uictis* (woe to the conquered) that make its part of speech ambiguous. In biblical Latin, *vae* is extremely common (especially in prophetic denunciations), which may explain its prominence here.

### Philosophical Games (*Ludi*)

The chapter's conclusion shifts unexpectedly from grammar to riddling wisdom literature. The term *ludi* (games, jests, plays) signals a different register—philosophical entertainment rather than technical instruction. This genre of learned riddles has parallels in the Anglo-Latin *Aenigmata* of Aldhelm and others, as well as in Irish wisdom literature.

### Aeneas's Three Sayings

**The Worn Stone**: The image of a stone worn by water teaching wisdom inverts the expected meaning. Normally, water wearing stone suggests persistence and gradual effect (as in the proverb *gutta cavat lapidem*, "the drop hollows the stone"). But Aeneas draws a pessimistic conclusion: the wise person is "worn away" by studies and dwells in the world "without profit" (*infoenosum*—a rare word meaning "without interest/return"). This may reflect monastic ambivalence about secular learning.

**The Sun as Horse**: This allegorical reading of sunrise and sunset is richly developed:
- The sun = a horse leaping from its stable
- The stable/barrier (*repagulum*) = the sea (from which the sun rises)
- The field = the sky
- The mule = the moon
- The foals = the stars

The imagery of celestial bodies as horses or chariots is ancient (cf. Helios's chariot), but the specific identification of the moon as a mule (*mula*) is unusual and perhaps deliberately comic. Mules, being sterile hybrids, make an odd choice for the moon, which governs fertility in much ancient thought.

**Who Loves?**: The third saying—"Who loves? Only he who is not loved in return" (*Quis amat? Nisi qui non redamat*)—is a paradox about unrequited love. It may mean that true love is defined by not receiving reciprocation, or that only the unloved truly understand love. The compressed form resembles a *sententia* or philosophical maxim.

### Galbungus's Riddle

The riddle "What flies across a whole hour in one instant?" with answer "The human mind flying across the whole sky in a single moment" celebrates the speed of thought. The mind's ability to traverse cosmic distances instantaneously was a common ancient topos (cf. Lucretius on the speed of *simulacra*). The term *anthropeani mens* (human mind), with its Greek-derived adjective, marks this as philosophical discourse.

### Virgilius's *Lusculi*

The final passage—Virgilius's own "little jests" (*lusculi*, a diminutive of *lusus*)—is perhaps the most impenetrable text in all of Virgilius's work. Huemer confessed in his apparatus: "*lusculorum neque sensus extricare neque verba emendare potui*" (I was able neither to extract the sense of the little jests nor to emend the words).

The passage appears to be a cosmological or theological hymn, with recognizable elements:
- *uatum* (of prophets/seers)
- *ponticum... ponto* (of the sea... from the sea)
- *naturo naturum naturam* (wordplay on *natura*, nature)
- *flumen fontes fronda* (river, springs, foliage)
- *dei... deo* (of God... God)
- *trono trino uno* (throne, triune, one)
- *potente deo* (powerful God)
- *regna regnaturo* (kingdoms... to the one about to reign)
- *aeterno aeuo* (in eternal age)
- *secula* (ages)

The Trinitarian language (*trino uno*, "triune one") confirms Christian context. The text may be deliberately obscure (*glifia*), corrupt in transmission, or composed in one of Virgilius's invented Latinities. The promise that these jests will "build up the reader more than harm him" (*plus aedificent quam noceant*) suggests edifying intent beneath the opacity.

### The Ending

That the *Epistolae* conclude with impenetrable wordplay is fitting. Throughout his work, Virgilius has oscillated between lucid grammatical exposition and deliberate obscurity. To end with a passage that defeats even modern editors is perhaps the ultimate assertion of the limits of grammatical mastery: language finally escapes the grammarian's control.

The manuscript colophon—"FINIUNT BIS QUATERNE MARONIS EPISTOLAE FELICITER SALTORE PERSCRIPTAE" (The twice-four Letters of Maro end happily, written by Saltor)—identifies the scribe and confirms that eight letters were understood to comprise the complete work.

### The *Epistolae* as a Whole

With this eighth letter, Virgilius has covered all eight parts of speech recognized in ancient grammar: noun, pronoun, verb, adverb, participle, conjunction, preposition, and interjection. The *Epistolae* thus form a complete grammatical curriculum, parallel to but distinct from the *Epitomae*. Where the *Epitomae* treat the parts of speech more systematically, the *Epistolae* adopt a more discursive, anecdotal, and personal style appropriate to their epistolary form.

The progression from the substantial treatments of noun and verb to the briefer discussions of the "minor" parts of speech reflects traditional grammatical weighting. But Virgilius transforms this inherited structure through his invented authorities, exotic vocabularies, riddling wisdom, and moments of surprising insight. The result is a work that has puzzled and fascinated readers for over a millennium.
