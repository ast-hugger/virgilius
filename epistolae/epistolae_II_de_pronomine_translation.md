# THE LETTERS OF VIRGILIUS MARO
## II. ON THE PRONOUN

### English Translation

Unless perhaps our work were thought to limp, if its own letter had not also been rendered to the pronoun, and some portion of your desire seemed to be withheld from you, I would indeed wish to be silent about the pronoun rather than say anything—especially since so many have written many clear things about this part of speech, whether in their own little works or in places of other works occupied with these same matters, and I myself have announced a work proper to the pronoun in the *Epitomae*, fifteen in number. Nevertheless, lest I fall into that saying of Glengus, which he confidently dared to say to someone fleeing a dispute—"a coward," he said, "deserves a *fambulum*"—I shall speak forth a few things necessary to your business concerning the pronoun.

First in order is the definite pronoun *ego*, concerning which so many were ventilating innumerable questions, investigating how and by what reasoning the same pronoun is composed of such dissimilar letters, that one says *ego mei*. Many wished to settle the dispute learnedly in this way: they affirmed that *ego* ought always to be written among the monoptotes, so that *ego* would be said singularly in every number, gender, and case. Terrentius believed *ego* should be judged among the defectives, so that it would have no case except the nominative alone. Yet both parties with concordant exhortation and definite decree said that *mius* should be accepted for *ego* and declined thus: *mius mei* or *mis mihi me*, O, *a me*. To these the students of Galbungus, resisting from the opposite direction, said: "If it is so, why is the order of letters not preserved also in the plural number? But it is declined thus: *nos nostrum*?" Otherwise there are very many things which, although they do not preserve the order of letters, are nevertheless not doubted to be fitting in sense and meaning. In a similar way, therefore, this pronoun must be defended as properly to be declined, just as very many have accepted *ego mei* and in the plural *nos nostrum*.

When I had referred this question to my Aeneas, and for a long portion of the day we had turned over many things concerning this same matter, at the end he concluded thus: that according to the opinion of Galbungus and his followers, *mius mei mihi* is most correctly written. But we are compelled by much reading of undoubted authors to believe that *ego*, like *nequam* and other declined words, has only one declension through all cases—as Servilius writes: "*agrum ego rapuerunt*," which is to say "they seized my field." And again a certain Galbungus, a veteran established in the regions of India, in the closing of one of his works speaks thus: "*num ego debitam, fili, fraudabis mercedem?*" ["Will you cheat me of the owed reward, son?"] He put *ego* for *mihi*. Virgilius Assianus also, in the fourth book of his *Dispositions on the Genesis of Man*, begins thus: "*quis ego condidit, ut sic essem?*" This means: "Who created me?" Sarbon also, father of Glengus, in the Song of Queen Rigadis: "*digna ab ego laudari carmento mirabili*," that is, "worthy to be praised by me with a wondrous song."

And lest anyone seem to deny that *ego* has a plural, we shall set forth examples found here and there. Latomius, my fellow-student, in a certain plaintive song spoke thus: "*ego quid simus acturi, quibus agri sunt direpti?*" ["What are we to do, we whose fields have been plundered?"] *Ego* here is put for *nos*. Fassica also, a woman so wise and so learned that her name will certainly be celebrated without doubt until the day when the world shall end, used this example among others: "*patres ego tradiderunt omnia quibus utimur peritiae instrumenta*" ["The fathers handed down to us all the instruments of skill which we use"]; this seems to me to mean "the fathers handed down to us." Sarricius also, the father of Cicero: "*quid*" he says "*ego uita carpitur?*" This is to say "our life" or "the life of us." But let these things suffice concerning these matters, for the same can be understood concerning the rest.

But Galbungus and Terrentius are reported to have remained in such a contention for fourteen days and as many nights, that they might prove from all the traditions of the ancient teachers whether *ego* has a vocative case or not. Terrentius denied that *ego* has a vocative case, since the vocative case must always be joined to the second person, but *ego* will always pertain to the first person. Galbungus affirmed that a vocative case can occur to this pronoun, especially in that place where a verb of the first person would be held under the mode of interrogation, as if you should say "*o egone recte feci uel dixi?*" ["O, did I do or speak rightly?"] But this vocative, that is *ego*, cannot stand without the help of *o* and *ne* placed around it.

When this question was referred to Aeneas with me as intermediary, he ventilated it most truly thus: since *ego* is a noun of the first person, and a verb of the first person does not have the imperative mood, to which the accusative case is always attached, this pronoun would retain a vocative case only when it would be said under the mode of interrogation: "*o egone recte feci uel locutus sum?*" Yet that a vocative case is found in the plural number can come into doubt for no one, not even for either contending party—as *nos*, O, *a nobis*—especially since the imperative mood is also accustomed to be inflected in the plural number of the first person. For when you say "*nos dicamus*" ["let us speak"], *nos* in this place can be a vocative case, although it is not denied to be also a nominative. But let enough be said about this pronoun.

This pronoun, however, receives two compositions: either when it itself is doubled, as *egoego*, or when it receives the syllable *met*, as *egomet*. Thus *tutu*, *tumet*, *sese*, *semet*. There is also a certain difficult question concerning pronouns, quite in need of a solution: for when we say *meus tuus suus* and in the plural number *noster uester*, it is asked what third person we ought to place here? Some deny that a third person ought to be taken in this place at all. Some, for a certain comfort of writers and readers, define that third person which we had placed in the singular number—that is, *suus*—to be common, so that they say thus: *meus tuus suus noster uester suus*. We do not freely dare either to believe them or to disbelieve them entirely, especially since they find no reason in this place by which they preserve the third person, nor again that it can or ought to be resumed irreproachably.

There is a pronoun about which great doubt is held, whether it is definite or indefinite, such as *iste*. Some indeed urge that it is indefinite, with a certain authority of their own defense, as *ego iste*, *tu iste*, *ille iste*; which however we have not found so readily or preparedly held in use in our readings. For I have read this in only one place, when Cato said "*ego iste qui locutus sum*," and whether he placed it correctly or otherwise, it is not for my judgment to decide or define—since the whole region of Latinity is so great and so copious and, so to speak, an immense sea, that the diversities of it and new inventions, thought to be unknown, can be clearly discerned by no one at all.

There are those who think the pronoun *alius* has a genitive case, which is to be believed to have been adopted speculatively rather than reasonably. For some think this pronoun should be declined thus: *alius alius ali*. Many also decline it thus: *alius ali alio*. Some were devising *alius alis* or *alionis*. But all these things will be able to be proven from no certain authority: for they will not be able to bring forth the sayings of Cicero, of Don, of Cato, of Virgilius Assianus or that Trojan one, or of Galbungus or Terrentius or any of the others who made many works concerning the arts and wrote elegantly and most beautifully, for establishing this case. Concerning this pronoun, therefore, this opinion must be preserved: that it cannot have a genitive case.

There are pronouns about which it is disputed whether they should be understood as pronouns or adverbs, such as *eccum* and *ellum*. There are pronouns for which an affected or exchanged declension is asserted, as *cuius cui cuio*. I know also *cuia cuiae* and *cuium cui*. But this declension is not to be referred to authority. There is also a pronoun to be declined according to each number through four cases—two nominative cases, both singular and plural, and likewise two accusatives—as *nostras nostrates*, *cuias cuiates*. But that we may prove these same things to be true by examples, Donatus in a certain song composed thus, saying:

> *Nostras omnis familia,*
> *nostrates quoque pecora*
> *euadant inminentia*
> *hostilium pericula.*

> [May our whole household,
> and our cattle too,
> escape the threatening
> perils of the enemy.]

Gabritius also says: "*nostrates* salutate fratres, quia et *nostrates* uos undique salutant" ["Greet our countrymen, brothers, because our countrymen too greet you from everywhere"]. Terrentius also in the fourth book of his *Grammatical Dispositions* issued such a proem: "*Cuias* gens et *cuiates* populi litteris tam prompte dediti sunt quam Tusci, quorum natura fertur ab infantiae annis sapientiae studere soli et nihil aliud amare quam semper philosophare?" ["What nation and what peoples are so readily devoted to letters as the Tuscans, whose nature is said from the years of infancy to study wisdom alone and to love nothing else than always to philosophize?"]

There are pronouns which seem to be ready and well-known, but are thought to be deficient in other cases, such as *solus*, *totus*, *alter alterius*. But if anyone applies himself to all the readings of Latinity, he will manifestly find all the cases of these pronouns properly declined, as *solus solius soli solum a solo*, and in the plural *soli solorum solis solos a solis*. Although some do not accept the genitive case of the plural number in pronouns—*solorum totorum alterorum*—nevertheless I remember having read these cases declined commonly and plainly, neither rarely nor in uncertain authors. Just as I read in Quintilianus, who was a computist of days and months and of the moon and sun: "*totorum*," he says, "*mensium quibus in sese reciproca successione reuoluitur annus, supputatio perdifficilis est et intellectu egens diligenti*" ["The calculation of all the months by which the year revolves in reciprocal succession upon itself is very difficult and in need of diligent understanding"]. And below: "*solorum*," he says, "*industriorum uirorum bella quis narrabit?*" ["Who will narrate the wars of only the industrious men?"]

There are also those who think *plures* should be accepted among the pronouns, to whose opinion we neither greatly distrust nor excessively favor. But we shall attempt to explain the question that arises as best we can. Many deny that a singular number can be found for *pluribus*, but that it is declined thus: *plures plurum pluribus*. And so it must be asked: if these are pronouns, why are they said by many to receive degrees of comparison, when a pronoun cannot have comparison—especially since *pluriores* is written by some, which is to be said in the comparative degree? Whence it is manifest that these are adjective nouns rather than pronouns, especially since they are also said to have a superlative degree, as *plurimi*. But the singular number is not easily found in these nouns, except in the neuter gender, for one says *plus*. Beyond what is said in the nominative case, the inflection of singular number fails. Some say *plus* pertains to three genders, which does not seem to me to be customary.

Concerning the pronoun I would think enough had been said, except that many wish to cast more questions from us: what is the difference between *illice* and *istice*, how articles differ from pronouns, and why the articles themselves are so called. *Ille*, as they say, is accepted for a famous meaning, either in a good or in a contrary sense. Thus Aeneas, the most skilled teacher of rhetoricians and grammarians and poets, praising Aeneas the warrior of Troy, says: "*felix*," he says, "*ille Aeneas qui decies uictor Troia fugit incensa atque in Indiam pergens quinque continuis proelians annis uitam bellando feliciter finiuit*" ["Happy was that famous Aeneas who, ten times a victor, fled from burning Troy and, heading toward India, fighting for five continuous years, ended his life happily in battle"]. That *ille* is also accepted in a bad sense is manifest from the very words of a certain Iscenus the African, by which he vilifies a certain Donatus, a greedy man: "*Quid faciet*," he says, "*ille Donatus auarus in propriis, cupidus in alienis, fur uorax?*" ["What will that Donatus do, miserly in his own things, greedy for others', a voracious thief?"] To this, although by another path, we wish to teach what the difference is between *cupidus* and *auarus*, which it hints at. For *cupidus* is he who always desires to increase; but *auarus* is he who, holding onto what has been gathered, gives to no one. *Iste* is held for a person of whatever common and rather lowly sort.

Concerning articles, however, the opinion of some is diverse. For some maintain that they are judged to be articles for this reason: because they are inflected together with the nouns themselves, as *hic homo*, *huius hominis*. If it is so, let them choose whether they call all pronouns articles, because all can adhere to the nouns themselves in declension, or whether none of the articles except *hic* is received as an article, because the others can be declined separately—especially since we often hear *hic* too separately. These are *hic is quis qui tu se*, although *se* lacks a nominative case. Whence it also seems truer to me, as our people assert, that every monosyllabic pronoun is called an article—with which Cicero especially agrees. *Articulum* is manifestly a diminutive of *ante*, whence also it seems to many that it is called an *articulum* when it shall be monosyllabic, as *hic quis is*, and this is of simple form; but when it shall be compound, it is a pronoun, as *quisque*, *idem*, *hicce*. This much concerning articles.

Alas! It is truly worthy of all pity that many have corrupted these articles according to their order. For what ought to have been subjunctive, they have made prepositive; and conversely what ought to have been placed before is illegitimately placed after. According to Gallienus writing in a certain letter: "*sciat hic in sese uindicatum*" ["let him know that vengeance has been taken on him"]. For he ought to have said "*hic sciat*." Rectius also, writing most wrongly, spoke thus: "*is erat uir ualde bonus et maxime prudens*" ["He was a very good and most prudent man"]. He ought, if he had been master of his own brain, to have composed it thus: "*erat is ualde bonus uir*." This they have done in pronouns, as they have also often placed the copulative conjunction in a contrary manner, corrupting its order, placing the copulative conjunction *que* before and placing it after in order. Thus a certain Gaul of ours, indeed baptized, arguing against the pagans, says: "*adorant*," he says, "*quidem solemque lunam*," when he ought to have said "*adorant solem lunamque*" ["they worship the sun and moon"]. Terrentius also, son of Terrentius, placed it in the contrary way: "*uiri mulieres et*," for he manifestly ought to have said "*uiri et mulieres*" ["men and women"].

I would have many things of this sort which I could discuss, except that it is too long to examine everything. For just as any traveler walking on a proposed road, if he should wish to turn aside by another path, incurs no small delays in his journey—especially if he has proposed to hasten—so also those who give themselves to the office of writing, if having entered upon the road of the work they have seized upon they hasten amid other writings, will necessarily fall into much delay in their work, so much so that, occupied with many digressions, it begins to be unknown by some which road they are chiefly walking. Whence I seem to see tedium arise for many readers, while fatigued by long circuits of writing they at last find the path of the sense they had begun. For most rightly by the name of feet are the minds of men called, which, making their way through the fields of meditations on wisdom and also the forests of most difficult questions, always employ immoderate haste so much that they grow weary day and night, kindled by so great a desire that they wish quickly to find the meaning which lies hidden or which is deferred.

There are also pronouns which some believe to be adjectives, as *talis* and *qualis* are read. These nouns of the first position do not occur to pronouns, either because they are declined in the manner of adjective nouns, as *talis talis qualis qualis*—a custom which does not usually occur to pronouns. For the genitive case of many pronouns in declining terminates in the syllable *ius* and of none in *is*. Finally, those who write the art of pronouns, with this doubt impeding confidence of speech, saying that the genders of pronouns are nearly the same as those of nouns, do not dare confidently to say that the genders of pronouns are the same as those of nouns, since they hear from most teachers that the common of two is not legitimately had for the genders of pronouns—this cause supporting them, that from those aforementioned nouns, which are *talis* and *qualis*, adverbs are evidently accustomed to be born, as *taliter* and *qualiter*. For although adverbs are said to come from pronouns, as *meatim tuatim suatim nostratim uestratim*, nevertheless they are denied to be able to go out properly into the syllable *ter* in Latin except from adjective nouns. There is also another cause by which these nouns should be judged adjectives rather than pronouns: because they have a neuter noun in *e*, as *tale* and *quale*. Let such things be said concerning these pronouns or nouns.

There are other pronouns which are called geminate, as *quis* and *qui*, *quae* and *qua*, *quod* and *quid*: whence also in the ablative case we have *a quo* or *a qui*, *a qua* or *a qui*, *a quibus* or *a quis*. Yet to some it has seemed that *qui* possesses another declension, so that it would be inflected in three ways, however—in the nominative of each number and in the ablative likewise of each number. Some contend that *qui* can be fitted to every gender, inasmuch as in the ablative we say *a qui uiro*, *a qui muliere*, *a qui opere*. Or if their opinion must stand, *qui* will enjoy a kind of monoptote declension through every number and every case, as *qui uir*, *qui uiri*, *qui uiro*, *qui uirum*; *qui mulier*, *qui mulieris* and *qui mulieres*, *qui mulierum*; *qui nomen*, *qui nominis*, *qui nomina*, *qui nominum*, and other things of this sort.

Some attempt to inflect each pronoun separately and have it thus: *quis*, *quuius*, *quui*, *quem*, *a quo*; *qui*, *quorum*, *quibus*, *quos*, *a quibus*. Another way: *qui*, *quius*, *quium*, O, *a qui*, and in the plural number two *i*'s are placed, as *quii quium*, *quiis*, *quios*, O, *a quiis*. Thus also *quae*, *cuius*, *cui* (which two cases are placed through *c* for the sake of distinction of these declensions, not otherwise) *quam*, O, *a qua*; and in the plural *quae*, *quarum*, *quibus*, *quas*, *a quibus*. Another way: *qua* and in the genitive through two *e*'s *quaeae*, *quaeae*, *quaeam*, *a quaea* or *a qui*, *quaeae*, *quaearum*, *quis*, *quaeas*, *a quiis*; and in the neuter *quod*, *quuius*, *quui*, *quod*, O, *a quo*, *quae*, *quorum*, *quibus*, *quae*, O, *a quibus*. Another way: *quid*, *quius*, *quii*, *quid*, O, *a qui*; and in the plural *quaeae*, *quaeeorum* or *quium*, as seems better, *quis*, *quaeae*, *quibus*, O, *a quibus*.

These things, most holy deacon, briefly said concerning the principle of the pronoun, seek an opportune end for themselves.

## Translator's Notes

### The Opening Apology

Virgilius begins with a conventional *recusatio*—a rhetorical gesture of reluctance to write—claiming he would prefer to remain silent about the pronoun, since he has already treated it in the *Epitomae* and others have written so much on the topic. Such protestations of modesty, followed by copious treatment of the subject anyway, are standard in ancient and medieval technical literature. The reference to his "fifteen *Epitomae*" (*epitomis ter quinis numero*) confirms that the *Epitomae* were conceived as a set of fifteen, though only twelve survive complete.

### Glengus and the *Fambulum*

The saying attributed to Glengus—"*gurgo fugax fambulo dignus est*"—contains two obscure words. *Gurgo* appears to mean "coward" or "sluggard" (perhaps related to *gurgustium*, a hovel, or an invented formation). The word *fambulum* is entirely mysterious; Virgilius does not explain it. This is characteristic of his style: he drops strange words without gloss, expecting the reader either to understand or to be appropriately baffled. Law (1995) sees such unexplained terms as part of Virgilius's pedagogical strategy of cultivating attentive, questioning readers.

### The Declension of *Ego*

The elaborate discussion of how to decline *ego* is partly a parody of real grammatical controversies and partly a vehicle for Virgilius's invented authorities. The basic problem—that *ego* and its oblique forms (*mei*, *mihi*, *me*) share no common root—was genuinely noted by ancient grammarians. Virgilius's solution, proposing *mius* as an alternative nominative, is invented but linguistically coherent.

The claim that *ego* can function as any case (genitive "my," dative "to me," etc.) allows Virgilius to cite a series of impossible Latin sentences from his invented authorities, each using *ego* where a different case would be expected. These citations have a certain surreal poetry: "*agrum ego rapuerunt*" (they seized my field), "*quis ego condidit?*" (who created me?), "*digna ab ego laudari*" (worthy to be praised by me).

### Virgilius Assianus and the Three Virgils

The reference to "Virgilius Assianus" (Virgil of Asia) and "that Trojan one" (*illius Troiani*) reflects Virgilius's doctrine of multiple authors bearing the same name. In the *Epitomae*, he describes three Virgils: one from Asia, one from Troy, and the historical poet. This multiplicity may parody the ancient biographical tradition, which often conflated different figures, or it may reflect a genuine interest in the plurality of textual transmission. The absence of the historical Virgil (the poet of the *Aeneid*) from his lists of authorities is conspicuous and probably deliberate.

### The Fourteen-Day Debate

The famous dispute between Galbungus and Terrentius over the vocative of *ego*—lasting fourteen days and nights—is one of the most celebrated passages in Virgilius's works. It has been read as parody of grammatical pedantry, as satire on ecclesiastical councils (which could debate minute theological points for extended periods), and as a meditation on the limits of rational inquiry.

The resolution offered by Aeneas—that *ego* can have a vocative only in interrogative sentences with *o* and *-ne* attached ("*o egone recte feci?*")—is grammatically ingenious, finding a narrow exception to the general rule. Whether this represents genuine linguistic insight or mock-scholastic hairsplitting remains, characteristically, ambiguous.

### Fassica the Wise Woman

The mention of Fassica (*Fassica quoque femina tam sapiens et tam scolastica*) as a grammatical authority is remarkable. Female scholars are rarely cited in ancient or medieval grammatical literature. Whether Fassica is an invention or reflects knowledge of actual learned women in Virgilius's milieu is unknown. The praise of her—that her name will be celebrated "until the day when the world shall end"—is extravagant even by Virgilian standards.

### Sarricius, Father of Cicero

The claim that Sarricius was Cicero's father contradicts the historical record (Cicero's father was Marcus Tullius Cicero the Elder). This is typical of Virgilius's technique of attributing impossible relationships to known figures. The name Sarricius may be invented or may echo some lost source.

### The Verse of Donatus

The quatrain attributed to Donatus demonstrates the forms *nostras* (singular) and *nostrates* (plural). The verse itself is metrically irregular by classical standards—it appears to be rhythmic rather than quantitative poetry, with lines organized by syllable count and stress rather than by long and short syllables. This is consistent with the transition from quantitative to accentual verse occurring in late antique and early medieval Latin. The content—a prayer for household and livestock to escape enemy danger—suggests a practical, perhaps liturgical context.

### Quintilianus the Computist

The "Quintilianus" cited here is not the famous rhetorician (Marcus Fabius Quintilianus, author of the *Institutio Oratoria*), but a "computist of days and months and of the moon and sun" (*computarius dierum et mensuum et lunae et solis*). Computus—the calculation of the Easter date—was a major intellectual enterprise in early medieval Ireland and Britain. This anachronistic Quintilianus who uses the controversial genitives *totorum* and *solorum* is clearly Virgilius's invention, designed to provide authority for forms that other grammarians rejected.

### Aeneas on Aeneas

One of Virgilius's most disorienting passages has "Aeneas, the most skilled teacher of rhetoricians and grammarians and poets" praising "Aeneas the warrior of Troy." The content of the praise is itself bizarre: this Aeneas fled Troy "ten times a victor," went to India (!), fought for five years, and "ended his life happily in battle." None of this corresponds to the *Aeneid*, where Aeneas goes to Italy and (in most versions) does not die in battle at all.

Zetzel (1995) and others have seen this as a meditation on the relationship between text and commentary, author and character—the grammarian Aeneas commenting on the hero Aeneas in a work by Virgilius about grammar. The Indian destination may reflect legendary Alexander traditions, or it may be pure invention.

### Articles and Pronouns

The discussion of whether monosyllabic pronouns should be called "articles" (*articula*) reflects a genuine terminological problem in Latin grammar. Latin lacks the definite and indefinite articles of Greek and the modern Romance languages, but grammarians borrowed the Greek term *arthron* (joint, article) for certain Latin pronouns. Virgilius's proposal—that monosyllabic pronouns are articles, polysyllabic ones are pronouns—is neat but not generally accepted.

The etymology of *articulum* from *ante* is fanciful; the word actually derives from *artus* (joint), referring to the article's function of "joining" to a noun.

### Word Order Criticism

The complaints about wrong word order—pronouns placed after rather than before, the conjunction *-que* placed before its word rather than attached after—represent genuine late Latin and medieval Latin developments. The enclitic *-que* was originally attached to the second of two conjoined elements (*solem lunamque*, "sun and moon"), but in later Latin it sometimes floated free or appeared in unexpected positions. Virgilius's horror at "*solemque lunam*" and "*uiri mulieres et*" is presented as grammatical conservatism, defending classical norms against contemporary corruption.

The "Gaul of ours, indeed baptized" (*Gallus noster quidem babtizatus*) who makes this error while arguing against pagans is a wonderfully precise social portrait—a recent convert, still writing imperfect Latin, attempting theological polemic.

### The Forest of Questions

The extended metaphor near the chapter's end—comparing the reader's mind to feet walking through "fields of meditations on wisdom" and "forests of most difficult questions"—is characteristic of Virgilius's tendency toward allegorical elaboration. The self-aware apology for digression (while continuing to digress) is a rhetorical technique also found in Augustine and other late antique writers.

### Adverbs from Pronouns

The invented pronominal adverbs *meatim*, *tuatim*, *suatim*, *nostratim*, *uestratim* (roughly: "in my way," "in your way," etc.) do not exist in classical Latin. They are formed on analogy with genuine adverbs like *paulatim* (gradually) and *separatim* (separately). Whether Virgilius invented them or drew on actual Insular Latin usage is debated. Such formations would be morphologically possible in Latin, even if unattested.

### The Geminate Pronouns

The elaborate alternative declensions for *quis/qui* and related pronouns at the chapter's end are dizzying. Forms like *quuius*, *quaeae*, *quaeeorum* do not occur in any known Latin text. Whether these represent Virgilius's invention, garbled transmission, or some actual dialectal or experimental usage is impossible to determine. The overall effect is of language proliferating beyond control—a multiplication of forms that parodies the grammatical tradition's obsession with complete paradigms.

### The Closing

The brief closing address to "most holy deacon" (*diacone sanctissime*) returns us to the epistolary frame, reminding us that these grammatical investigations are ostensibly a letter to Julius Germanus. The phrase "seek an opportune end for themselves" (*oportunum sibi petunt finem*) gives the discourse a kind of agency, as if the words themselves are tired and seeking rest.
