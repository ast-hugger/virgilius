# THE LETTERS OF VIRGILIUS MARO
## III. ON THE VERB

### English Translation

Before we put our hand to the explanation of the verb, a matter on which we have previously added small though varied treatments in the *Epitomae*, I think we must respond to those who bark and tear at us with profane and canine mouth, saying that we seem in all the arts to contradict ourselves mutually, since what one affirms, another seems to destroy—not knowing that Latinity is so great and so profound that it is necessary to explain it in manifold and various senses. For what sensible person would think Latinity to be held so narrow and so confined that each word seems content with only one manner and one sense, especially since there are held to be twelve kinds of Latinity itself in number, and each kind embraces many arts within itself?

Let every reader, therefore, and everyone examining with sound sense (if indeed he is tortured by no disease of envy; for nothing envious can perceive soundly, since while he envies others, he defrauds himself of the open light of truth)—every reader, I say, striving with subtle mind to attend to the manifold ways of Latin speech, let him consider first the force and nature of speech itself, if indeed it can be rightly considered by anyone given its subtlety and abundance. Then let him know that there are many causes on account of which the alteration of individual words is accustomed to happen: for all speech must serve now necessities, now distinctions of persons, now compositions of meters, now ornaments of eloquence. If anyone, therefore, could remove these from the middle—which nevertheless cannot happen at all—this person would be able to establish that one and the same way, custom, and meaning must always be preserved in all of Latinity. For just as there is indeed one royal and public road which leads to the metropolitan city, yet it has many little paths proceeding from itself, which themselves arrive at the same city (for if any two have entered upon one journey to any place, and one of them has determined to proceed by the broad and public road, while the other has preferred to walk a little path as if more expedient, they nevertheless meet in the same city), so also this Latinity of which we treat, while it consists as one language in its own property, nevertheless has so many, indeed almost innumerable, meanings and expressions, by which, though by a diverse path of speech, the truth of one language is nevertheless proven.

We have said these things, moreover, because although all parts of speech have some dissonances among most writers, yet a much greater forest of most difficult questions and byways of dissonances are found in the verb. Whence we have discovered that many councils were held among the Romans concerning the explanation of the verb, over which many most famous men presided—I mean Iulianus and Terrentius, Galbungus also and Glengus, and two Gregories, Regulus, and Reginus Cornilius, a man sufficiently eloquent, a most ready interpreter of the Greek and Hebrew languages, whose brilliance of talent in Latin speech was so great that he seemed to leave nothing obscure. He, receiving me also and the two sons of Iulianus—Donatus the grammarian and Don, first a rhetorician and grammarian together, afterward a faithful man now a priest—coming to him kindly and most willingly, taught the rhetorical art in one full month and the poetic art in another and grammar from the rest, and thus with a year passed in his scholarly community in the practice of day and night, as if a certain summit by which we might arrive at the highest mastery, we attained a small part at least for our mediocrity in all our studentship.

When we asked him about the state of the verb, whether the same state could be preserved in one and the same manner, he gave us this response with the greatest exultation: that the verb ought to be similar to a king, whose states of mind are many and diverse. For he does not reign in one manner in peace and in war, nor in joy and in sadness; sometimes he must be rigid, sometimes mild, now showing the strength of royal power, now bringing forth clemency and a certain weak gentleness. In a similar manner also the verb contains many states within itself: for now it bestows strength upon the weak, now it takes firmness away from the strong. Thus spoke Cornilius, whose opinions we shall set forth below, when we have begun to investigate the exposition of the verb itself. But now, with a little preface sent ahead, as if defended by a certain apologetic shield against adversaries, let us extend the hands of our pen to the verb itself.

The verb is indeed understood and called a part of speech in a manner customary among almost all; yet by most teachers it is believed to be held not as one part of speech, but as twelve parts, which we must explain by number, since we have begun to set them forth. The first part of the verb is *status*; the second, *formatio*; the third, *ordinatio*; the fourth, *moderatio*; the fifth, *subfiguratio*; the sixth, *adnumeratio*; the seventh, *inmotatio*; the eighth, *indagatio*; the ninth, *adfirmatio*; the tenth, *inchogatio*; the eleventh, *praelatio*; the twelfth, *declinatio*. These twelve parts the above-mentioned Cornilius and Galbungus explained to us most fully and clearly. Terrentius, bellowing and resisting against them like a bull with horned brow, said that the verb holds only one single part of speech. Which indeed we have known to be true in the number of those parts themselves, which are eight; but because the verb has meanings in many modes and many manners, Terrentius ought not to have opposed the teachers who ascribe these twelve parts to the verb, who unless they have proven them legitimately, then they are to be reproved and torn apart.

The *status* of the verb, therefore, is this: that all diction and reasoning and meaning is deferred until the utterance of the verb and is in a way rendered mute. Just as the people can use almost nothing until the king's sentence and authority, nothing does speech avail, nothing does number and counsel profit, so also all parts of speech, although they be numerous and clear, are nevertheless weakened and nullified unless the verb is present. Whence also the *status* of the verb is called *uirtus* by some. Which is most true, because the force of testimony is handed down in the indicative or imperative or especially in the mood which are called the two strongest moods in the speech of the verb. Some say that the *status* of the verb is this: when the verb alone is pronounced without any help of another part of speech, as *lego* or *dico* or *dixi*. But if this is so, where will the force appear, if the verb has not seemed to act? For the force of an active verb is recognized not only in this, that the verb itself is spoken first in all speech, but also when it adheres to the active case.

Concerning this *status* the above-mentioned Cornilius published a most elegant book, which if you wish to read, you have it at hand. From which I shall take only one word, or rather a chapter from the word, in which the *status* of the verb may evidently appear. Understand why it is called *status*: because in the first place the verb is established at the fronts of words, even if with inverted inscription. Whence those err who think the *status* of the verb should be so called because the verb is declined through order: for when you say *status*, it ought to be understood from no other manner than that it stands or is established. Whence also concerning the state of man we say this, that the man seems to stand perseveringly in what he has begun. Just as Origines the African in a certain volume published concerning the state of man spoke thus: "The state of man," he says, "if it remains in what was begun, will have nothing of instability, but will be considered in a way immutable and eternal."

When the Romans read this Origen (faithful except that he was a pagan), they decreed that he should be received among the books of the faithful. For the Roman church held and preserved this custom from the authority of the apostolic men, that the books of Christian philosophers should be kept stored apart from the writings of the pagans. For since men born and educated in the liberal studies of secular literature necessarily had it that the faithful still retained the habit of wisdom itself, the ecclesiastical teachers, seeing that they could not be torn away from this intention which they had begun, and at the same time because for the most part eloquent men were going to be useful for composing and adorning the writings of celestial and divine wisdom, if converted to the Lord and remaining in their eloquence they turned depraved studies to right ones, they most advisedly established this: that with two libraries composed, one should contain the books of faithful philosophers and the other the writings of the pagans, lest mixing unfaithful things with faithful there should be no distinction between clean and unclean, so that if anyone wished to read pagan things, he should have them set apart. But let these things be enough concerning these matters.

Now concerning the *formatio* of the verb, which we said was the second part, a few things must be spoken. *Formatio* is that by which we judge verbs must be inclined into forms. Forms, however, are customarily said to be four: but it seems contrary to me if that perfection of the whole declension is called a form, since form is to be believed to pertain not to declension but to a certain imagination of derivative likeness. The forms, therefore, are evident and customary, of which the first is called frequentative; which in the school of Galbungus was not accustomed to be taken, but rather they were accustomed to call it adjective, saying that it must be added not only to letters but also to meanings. Some called it not adjective but accumulative: for when you say *uictito*, you give this to be understood, as if you had said "I conquer more and more." There are those who use the frequentative form thus, if they have wished to write the same verb repeated, as *uinco uinco*: which some, thinking it ugly if they should write both verbs entire, nevertheless moderate this manner of writing by saying *uincinco* and in the preterite *uicici*; and thus *dicico* and *dixixi*, *legego* and *legegi*: which they also try to establish in verbs of the first conjugation in a devised manner, so that for *clamito* and *uocito* they have *clamamo* and *uocaco*, and thus according to the preterite tense *clamamaui* and *uocacaui*. Which because it is supported and sustained by no truth, is to be written not to authority but to ambiguity.

Nevertheless almost all of ours are accustomed often to string together in their writings words which have been inserted by vicious custom by both ancient and recent writers, for many reasons as I think: either for the sake of *glifia* itself, that is, to impede readers; or that I may excuse them more pardonably for the endurance of difficulty, or certainly that by this difficulty they may incite the minds of hearers and readers. And in this manner when these things have been adopted by the most learned masters of our time, they will be received not only by present writers as if for undoubted authority, but also by posterity. Just as in the book of a certain Falangis, a Lacedaemonian man, *scripsero* was read; which was thought by some to pertain to a verb of the first conjugation, because the writer imposed in jest the joining of the future tense with the indicative mood of the present tense, saying: "These things to you, friends, as if to sons of my people, I diligently commit and *scripsero*." For it is not to be believed (they say) that a learned man, when he had interposed a copulative conjunction, did not join two present verbs together. Whence also many of ours, especially of the Gauls, think this verb to be of the first conjugation, so that they often say *scripseraui* and *scripserabo* and *scripserare* and the rest. Thus also in certain writings of our Gauls we find *canno*, when we are accustomed to write *cano*. Finally a certain Bientius, exercising an epistolary hand, uses such beginnings: "To the *cannenti* lord Senenus." He put *cannenti* for *canenti*.

The inchoative form is that which seems indeed to be begun but not to be finished. Some wish it to be called not inchoative but defective form, because it fails in tenses; with which I also greatly agree. Yet some think this form should not be called inchoative for this reason, that it fails in tenses to be declined, since they say they often find *calesco calui*, *feruesco feruui*, *marcesco marcui*, *liquesco liqui*, *sarcesco sarcui*, *tacesco tacui*; but since the literal declension of the present tense seems to differ from the preterite, therefore they judge it ought to be called inchoative. To whom we shall most easily respond from the tradition of the elders that this reasoning is not true, that from those verbs which are of the inchoative form, preterite tenses are accustomed to be born, as *tacesco tacui*. Otherwise these verbs of the second conjugation, of which we are about to speak, will have what preterite tense, such as *taceo marceo sarceo ferueo caleo* and the rest, which without doubt must have a preterite tense. Inchoative verbs, therefore, are rightly to be called those which, when they have begun to be declined in the present tense, are nevertheless known to fail in the preterite tense.

Concerning these forms of verbs, between Regulus of the Cappadocians and Sedulus the Roman, no small dispute was held, which nearly came to the clash of swords. For fifteen nights and as many days together they remained sleepless and without food, with three thousand soldiers taken on each side. For Regulus said that these forms of verbs ought to be understood by other names, by other meanings also, and by other reasons than we have them in use. For he affirmed that the frequentative form could approach all verbs together; and also that the inchoative ministered to all conjugations, tenses, and verbs, as *calesco calescui*, and in the second person *caluisti*; and in such manner in the plural number *calescuimus caluistis*. He also said that each verb has two or three frequentative forms, as *lego lecto legito lectito*; and he taught that these three are of the first conjugation. He also said the inchoative form is dual, as *calesco calisco*, *liquesco liquisco*, *acesco acisco*.

To whom Sedulus the Roman, a man extremely sharp in talent and sufficiently florid in eloquence, gave such a most composed response: "O good man and most mild citizen, do not disturb the settled writings of the Romans, which from the very constitution of Latinity have endured unharmed and unshaken until now. For the most eloquent Roman writings composed these forms of verbs in their own lines and their own order, so that the frequentative form approaches certain verbs. For if you confidently assert that the same form approaches all verbs, you will necessarily have to bring forth examples by which you may show manifest proof of your opinion. For it is lawful for no one to speak anything beyond customary words without an example. For who will fashion for himself a way of speech which no predecessors have previously worn smooth? Therefore, that which you say—that there are three increases of the frequentative form and two of the inchoative—prove it by plain examples of the elders, so that if you have proven it, you may confer a double grace upon us: for you will show yourself an assertor of truth and will make us experienced in these things which perhaps we have utterly ignored."

To whom Regulus, putting forward many things from the authority of the ancients, proved that some of those things which he had said were most true; some of them were convicted by strongest destruction that they could not stand at all. From those things, however, which are doubted by no one to be true, we shall bring forth a few for the sake of example. "The frequentative form," he said, "has three efficacies and three increases; the first is that which delights in two syllables, as *lecto*, which indeed is seen to differ from the simple form somewhat obscurely: whence it is not so much received by many, because they assert that the frequentative form ought to differ as much in sense as in letters, or rather to increase. But we say thus, that he reads here (*legat*), which is at minimum to say the letters; but he *lectet* who begins to understand what he reads; but he *legitet* who understands what he reads and has made others read by handing down in the art of writing what he has learned by the habit of reading; furthermore he *lectitet* who will not cease from reading altogether. But verbs of the inchoative form can be of either conjugation, yet so that each conjugation claims an alternate verb for itself. For when you say *florisso*, it is known to be of the first conjugation, as *florisso florissas*; thus *calisso*, *patisso*, *parisso*. The teachers of these times in which we are present wonder why and how a verb of the first conjugation will not be declined through all tenses. For if it is declined, it cannot be inchoative: for that verbs of the first conjugation can go out through all tenses, the reading makes clear."

Concerning the meditative form, however, many are uncertain whether it ought to exist at all or not, with many denying and others affirming. This verb of the meditative form also uses a double name: for some call it meditative, as if from meditating; which to me diligently investigating always seems rather obscure. For when you say *uictorio*, I do not know how it pertains to meditation, whatever is understood in meaning; whether as we say "may we sometime conquer," or as some say "I wish to conquer," meditation does not seem to me to find a place here. Therefore we ought to say not meditative, although custom has brought this to us, but permissive or voluntative. Some among others use the verbs of this form declined through all tenses according to the first person only: which does not seem to me to be disapproved or approved.

We said the third part of the verb is *ordinatio*: in the storming of which we must delay a little, especially since the opinion of most people about it is so varied and so diverse that what the mind ought chiefly to seek for readers is either unknown or held ambiguously as conjectural. *Ordinatio*, therefore, is what we customarily call the conjugation of verbs: for what "yoke" sounds in letters, the order itself manifestly holds. Whence most of the elders thought that not conjugations but *ordinationes* ought to be written. The number of these *ordinationes*, however, many have confused by taking three, some four, others five or six. For beyond three, all their opinion wavers, although we think the fourth conjugation, or as we have in hand, *ordinatio*, is not so much to be rejected. Furthermore, most thought the third *ordinatio* should be divided into three, so that the first is that which is truly lengthened, as *audio*, *dormio*; which is most easily recognized in those moods or tenses which we are about to write below. For it is not right that slipping forgetfulness snatch away what has just now come to mind.

I remember that I was taught in such manner by a certain Lupus, a Christian man of Athens, sufficiently expert in the reasoning of verbs, when I asked him how and in what way and by what reasoning the order of difficult verbs was varied. "Do not believe sufficiently," he said, "in various opinions, son, because they are as many as the thoughts of men. Read therefore the books of individuals and examine and consider and see what in them is harmonious and unanimous, so to speak, and what divided and disagreeing: and whatever you find concordant and agreeing, suck this and pour it into your heart as a certain healthful and sweet wine; but whatever you find discordant and disagreeing, utterly avoid as poisonous and toxic." Whence I also have inserted this, that in the reasoning of verbs you should willingly receive whatever has been inserted by the elders and ancients. But those things which are in the middle and placed in a certain ambiguity, this you will neither reject nor affirm, and if you have heard it written, you will not contend whether it is taken for undoubted authority or for an ambiguous example.

What we promised we were about to say, however, is this: that the third conjugation lengthened is understood in special moods, that is, because in the indicative mood, present tense, first person, it is easily recognized—for you say *audio*, here it has *i* before *o* as in *lanio*—or on account of those verbs which are found neither wholly lengthened nor entirely shortened: you may have recourse to the preterite tense of the same mood perfect, where nothing doubtful will remain, as if you say *audiui*; then to the imperative mood as *audi*, then to the infinitive as *audire*. The second of the third conjugation lengthened, however, is this, which some think they ought to receive in the fourth conjugation, as *eo*, *is*, *it*. But they affirm that the third part of the same *ordinatio*, that is, the shortened conjugation, is the third, as *lego*. But the sixth which they bring to us in the number of *ordinationes*, no sane person at all ought to receive—of those verbs at least which end in the letter *um*, as *sum*, *prosum*, and the rest.

Asking Aeneas once about this matter, I heard from him such a response: "Disbelieve, O son," he says, "and do not receive with the tips of your ears if anyone suggests to you that any verb exists which ends in the letter *um*, of any conjugation; which thing has been introduced by men of corrupt mind and those who have received no reasoning from ancient writings, and wishing to prove and confirm wrong things as certain. They were taking certain quasi-species of conjugations, so that some said it is of the second conjugation; because although in the first person they do not go out in *eo* in the usual manner as *uideo*, certainly in the second person they end in *es*, as *es*. From whom we ought to inquire whether they find that the future tense of the same verb can go out in *bo* or in *bor*. But others most firmly contend that it is the third conjugation; because in the indicative mood, present tense, plural number, third person, it has *sunt*. But because throughout the whole verb they have nothing at all which truly shows the third conjugation, it is certainly probable that they err." Therefore, with the false and invented suspicions of the ignorant detected, indeed removed, we unhesitatingly define that every verb which, having a first person, does not end in the letter *o*, is of no conjugation.

Indeed this also is asked: why, when the authority of all our predecessors and teachers confirms that there are three *ordinationes*, in each *ordinatio* letters of another order are inserted in a quasi-confusable manner, so much so that in the first the second is found, and in the second and third the first; for you write thus: *lauda laudet*, *doce doceat*, *lege legat*, and therefore they anxiously ask by what reasoning this mixture was made. Concerning this, most of ours have asked both from us and from our parents. To whom it was answered advisedly that this is accepted not because it was done reasonably, but so that a distinction of moods and tenses might be had. For if in the imperative mood you say according to the first conjugation *lauda laudat*, *doce docet*, *lege leget*, it will not be thought that you wish to proclaim the indicative mood and the imperative. This also seemed to need insertion concerning *ordinationes*: why in every conjugation this order is preserved, that in the imperative mood the second person always remains in its own state. The solution of this question is easy, because this second person is compelled by no discrepancy to change its order.

Now concerning *moderatio* we must speak briefly indeed but fully. *Moderatio* is that by which verbs are weighed through moods: in which moderation the reasoners of numbers diligently inquire why there is a sextuple moderation; and rejoicing in a more profound understanding, they believe and assert that six moods of the verb were weighed by the ancient philosophers according to the six ages or times of the world: just as also the tenses of verbs have been measured in a triple order according to the times of the visible world.

In this sextuple moderation of verbs, therefore, certain questions arise. The first of them arises from those who thought that the moods of verbs ought also to be ordered according to the order of letters, so that they would begin the declension of the verb from the imperative mood; especially if it ended in the letter *a*, as *macta liga planta*, and from this finite mood the infinitive mood would follow, because it ends in the letter *e*, as *mactare ligare plantare*; then after this whole, when it had come to the indicative, beginning from the perfect preterite tense, which ends in the letter *ui*, as *mactaui ligaui plantaui*, they would establish an end to the verb in the present tense, because it terminates in *o*, as *macto ligo planto*. But because this opinion of theirs seems to be altogether more a forced suspicion than supported by the reason of truth, I think it better to be silent than to pursue the remaining order by which they use the moods in the second or third conjugation through the individual moods of any verb.

Some raise a question about the imperative mood, why it does not have a first person according to us, who deny that this can be said in Latin. Otherwise, in a certain volume which they entitle as written by Terrentius Marcillius, it is thus found: the imperative mood inflected according to three persons, just as the others. For it is thus had: *laudem*, *lauda*, and adding in the second person under distinction they write "or *laudes*." Thus *doceam*, *doce* or *doceas*; *audiam*, *audi* or *audias*; *quaeram*, *quaere* or *quaeras*, and with a neuter verb *sedeam*, *sede* or *sedeas*; *dormiam*, *dormi* or *dormias*. With passive, common, and deponent: *loquar*, *loquere* or *loquaris*; *glorier*, *gloriare* or *glorieris*; *horter*, *hortare* or *horteris*. And in the future tense of the same mood it is thus had: *laudem*, *laudato* or *laudes*, and thus through the other verbs. Whether this is full by this reasoning, or customary, or rather vicious, I do not wish boldly to discern; because even if we do not have it in use, by rare reading certainly of either the declension itself or of celebrated readings we are taught not to reject entirely, if by chance a first person should be found in the above-mentioned mood.

There is another question which moves some: how, as if with confused or mixed moods, the infinitive is joined to the indicative or optative, and also to the subjunctive. For you have thus: *dico dicis* or *dicere dicit*, *dicimus dicitis dicunt* or *dicere*. In the future tense: *dicam dices* or *dicere dicet*, *dicemus dicetis dicent* or *dicere*. In the optative mood also: *utinam dicerem diceres* or *dicere*. In the future: *utinam dicam dicas* or *dicere*, *dicant* or *dicere*; likewise *cum diceremus diceretis dicerent* or *dicere*: and in the passive verb *dicere* is found written in the same moods. And therefore they ask what the reasoning of this sort is, which converts the infinitive mood so flexibly and carries it around through every verb. To them we shall render the reasoning handed down and received from the elders: that the infinitive mood is accepted according to solecism for every mood.

And that this may become plain to you as to everyone, let us bring forth examples found here and there. A certain Catonius the African in a letter sent to the Romans concerning peace, when he says "pacem *facere*, pursue your advantages," this is to say "when you make." Virgilius Assianus also, in that work which he wrote in five volumes concerning the royal state, though in the Greek language, and which was translated into Latin by Galirius, a grammarian of our time, thus began saying: "The kings of old ruled their peoples by legitimate statutes of the gods according to customs usual to themselves; if the kings of this time also have imitated them, they will well and competently *regnare*." Here he put *regnare* for *regnabunt*.

But perhaps someone disapproving this may say that the Latin translator used such a transposition of moods because of ignorance of the Greek language. But let him not contend this: for even if in Greek dictions the infinitive mood ought not to be established for any other, certainly among the Latins, although according to vicious custom, it is certain to be found very often. Finally even Galbungus, whom no reasoning of knowing and composing Latinity could pass by, in his famous book of the praise of Roman emperors and soldiers, put the infinitive for other moods not once (lest he be thought to put it forgetfully rather than deliberately) but four times. In the first place of the book, saying thus: "The famous emperors are worthy of praise (*esse*)"; he put *esse* for *sunt*. But afterward, "the Roman soldiers," he says, "have an untiring zeal until always for their own to *uincere*. Certainly lest the lofty walls of Troy at the summit be destroyed (*disperdi*), they cautiously feared." Saying this, he assigns that the infinitive mood ought to be received in place of the optative. Later again after some things: "O Roman comrades and citizens" (in the imperative mood) "*consulere*."

Concerning the impersonal mood one question is ventilated on both sides, with the parties of Terrentius obstinately contending that the impersonal verb is accustomed to be born with undoubted assertion from every significative verb, that is, from active as from deponent, from neuter as from common, except passive. For what is derived from the active in the likeness of the third person of a passive verb does not repeat the passive again, especially since a passive verb cannot be asserted without a nominative case: but with the students of Galbungus contending that the impersonal mood can proceed from none but the active and neuter verb. With whom I too would easily agree, except that the parties of Terrentius have brought forth a thousand examples to us, by which they have made their opinion affirmable. We shall bring forth a few into the middle. For they say the teacher of the Atticans said: "*Criminatur*," he says, "by all, because we have spared with harsh dominion money to be lavished for the defense of friends." And again they bring forth the example of the old Donatus saying: "*Gaudetur* and *gloriatur* in our cities with the king returning from exile." But anyone perhaps when he has heard these things may presume to say that the same can rather be active and neuter verbs, from which these impersonals come, than common deponents, that is, *gaudeo* or *glorio*. Which even if I could find somewhere, nevertheless because it is not customary, I cannot affirm.

Concerning the optative mood also a famous and ventilable question arises, whether it shows only three efficacies of tenses in declension. Thus also reasoning continues, whether according to their understanding the mood does not receive the present tense and imperfect preterite, or rather two tenses are contained under one declension, either for the sake of the brevity of the Latin state or even, to speak more boldly, on account of narrowness, through two orders, so that when we say *utinam rogarem* it pertains to both tenses, that is, both present and imperfect preterite. Likewise when we say *utinam rogassem* it is conjoined to two running tenses: which I also think I have written in the work of the *Epitomae* ought to be so understood. Otherwise concerning the subjunctive mood, because there is no ambiguity, I think nothing need be treated. On account of which also some of the ancients thought the indicative mood should be reduced and received into the same aforementioned, that is, the subjunctive; with whom I too cannot refuse. As often, therefore, as the indicative mood does not make the head of a sentence, it necessarily makes a simple conjunction. We say "simple," however, because this custom of writing took its beginning not so much from the learned as from the simple and prosaic. Otherwise, among all the skilled of the Latins, every verb which did not pertain to the head of the utterance was always placed in the subjunctive mood.

Now concerning *subfiguratio* a rather brief speech must be said. First, therefore, it must be asked why composition occurs to a verb. For three causes, as I think; the first of which is for the sake of the completion or alteration of meanings; the second for the sake of metrical composition; the third is for the sake of composing the grace of speech itself. We said the first cause is that by which through compound figures meanings are either completed or altered. They are completed, indeed, when through this assumption of figures sentences are rendered more perfect and fuller, as if we should say *dico perdico*, *doceo perdoceo*, *facio perficio*. For *dico* and *doceo* and *facio* can be understood even from beginning: but when the end of teaching or speaking or doing work has arrived, then the *per* composition can be added. But meanings are altered through these *subfigurationes* for a double cause, either for the sake of destruction or for the sake of building. They are destroyed, indeed, when you say *dissipo* or *discredo*; the former looks to the destruction of a hedge; the latter to incredulity. But they are built when you say *consipo* and *concredo*; for what you have destroyed there, here you rebuild. Verbs are also composed for the sake of the composition of meters, as we said, just as we read in a certain verse of a Greek orator saying in this manner: "The wars of the Gauls throughout the whole world *con*cessent." Here indeed *con* added nothing to the sense, on account of which it only completed the verse. Let it suffice to have said these things concerning figures, especially since in the aforementioned work of the *Epitomae* we have said certain things more diligently concerning figures.

Now let us come to *annumeratio*. Many think that this *annumeratio* of verbs by simple writers is the same as the number occurring to the verb among the seven customary species, but we destroy this understanding most firmly, because simple number is dual, singular only and plural, but *annumeratio* reaches up to twenty-two species: which was done thus, as our people understand, because in the first language of the Hebrews the same number of elements and volumes was published: on which account also the ancient philosophers have ordered the verb from twenty-two species into one. And that this may be rendered more manifest to you, count up the individual species. You have, behold, first the quality of the verb, having ten species through moods and forms. For six moods indeed are had, and four forms. You have the triple conjugation and the fivefold signification. Here eight species are concluded. Through the double figure, however, and the dual number, this sum of the above-written is completed.

But why tense, which is triple, and person, which is likewise observed to be triple, should be excepted from this number, may perhaps be asked. It should be known accordingly that this is the custom of the Stoics: that when they have wished to put forward some type or number, they count up not so much the whole fullness of the sum as what pertains to the proposed type. One of whom, who was, as they thought, preeminent, Chromas by name, coming even to us, judged that only four vowel letters should be counted. When my Aeneas sought from him the reasoning of this matter, he rendered with tranquil utterance: "We too know," he said, "indeed that there are five letters which are called vowels; yet the ancient custom of our old parents was that they would measure no number without a type. Whence because no cardinal type has preceded the number five in Stoic calculation, they principally summed only four vowel letters with *u* subtracted. Or certainly for this reason some have not received the letter *u* among the vowels, because the ancients believed it ought to be called not so much a vowel as ambiguous, because sometimes it is accepted as a vowel, sometimes as a mute." But let us pass over this in silence.

That reasoning, however, on account of which they counted four vowel letters as if with prejudicial authority, is this: that this visible world consists of four elements, namely earth, fire, water, and air. Which Plastus set forth in a most elegant song saying:

> *Limo solubili,*
> *lympha meabili,*
> *igne ardibili,*
> *aura mutabili,*
> *mundus uisibilis*
> *sumptus initiis,*
> *cuius terribilis*
> *pendit fristities.*

> [From dissolvable mud,
> from passable water,
> from burnable fire,
> from changeable air,
> the visible world
> took its beginnings,
> whose terrible
> ending hangs.]

According to this reasoning, therefore, which the aforementioned Chromas brought forward, in this our *annumeratio* also, by which we count up the whole verb, we except tense and person, lest if these are accepted, twenty-eight species, as is necessary, should be found, and the number lack a type. Although if tense is divided into five species, with three persons added, eight species are found; which when we have added to twenty-two, according to lunar reasoning we shall make thirty.

Now a few things must be spoken by us concerning *inmotatio*; which is indeed unusual, but to those who are delighted by new inventions seems useful and necessary. Verbs are altered, however, simply through letters, through sounds, through meanings, through figures, through tenses. They are altered through letters, indeed, according to two efficacies, that is, either through disgraceful vice or through customary necessity. Through graceful vice also, when in a verse of Horace we read *aggo* for *ago*. Here the addition of the following *g* is vicious. But when joy or festivity is being celebrated, thus they have been accustomed to say *aggo*. For thus in the aforementioned verse it has: "And joyful they *aggunt* festivals in the walls." For they think it more ornate and more firm if they make a certain counterbalancing of the tongue through syllables. Whence also the same poet thought it more convenient to add *g* in the former syllable than to weigh one against four with a half-weighted number of letters. For this reason in most words consonant letters are doubled, as *cellum* for *celum* and *uellim* for *uelim* and *ollim* for *olim*.

They are altered, however, as we said, through customary necessity, when we have it in use to write *sperno* and *cerno*; when among the ancient teachers of Roman eloquence, and those especially whom the probability of their teachings made famous among all, they sensed that *spero* and *cero* ought to be put, rejecting that *r* and *n* can be written together without the interjection of any vowel. But because *cero* and *spero* have another effect (for *spero* received its name from *spes*, and *cero* has this meaning when someone composes from wax), therefore *n* was necessarily added for the sake of rejection and for certain vision.

They are altered also through sounds, because any two verbs are written with the same letters and syllables, but do not have the same effect, as *lego lego*; which unless they have been distinguished by sound, will be confusedly chosen; therefore *lego* from reading will be accented in the first syllable. For *lego* from legation will be shortened in the same syllable. They are altered also through meanings, differing neither in sound nor syllable nor letter, as *credo credo*. For *credo* is said of credulity, which is clear and open to all. There is also *credo* of swearing an oath, of which we shall bring forth examples (because perhaps it is unusual to others). Virgilius, teacher of the Trojan school, writing against the Romans and arguing that they are guilty of falsehood, thus begins: "O Romans, why, forgetful of your truth, have you wished to transgress what you have *credidistis*?" This is to say "what you have sworn." Cato also: "If anyone," he says, "should *discredat*, let him be justly condemned." This is "perjure." Thus also *lucror* has a double meaning: of acquiring money, and no less of escaping danger or death. Thus *cohibeo* will pertain to continence or to the indulgence and concession of something. They are altered also through figures, which can appear to all readers: yet we shall prove this by one example. For we say *construo* and *adstruo*; for one is of building, another of affirming. They are altered no less through tenses, when in the custom of reading we have it in use to write the present tense for the perfect preterite, as of Cato: "When they had come," he says, "both first the Romans *allocuntur*." This is "allocuti sunt" [addressed]. But by what reasoning this was adopted, few have been taught, unless because many of the Latins think it was handed down to them by the ancients that the present tense pertains to both, either because it is done at that time or because it passed by at a most certain time as if in present action.

Now let us come to the *indagatio* of the verb. The *indagatio* of the verb is understood in three ways: in conjugation, in declension, in meter. In conjugation, indeed, it is tracked down through three principal letters, which are *a e i*, by which as if by a certain tracking from the second person of the indicative mood every conjugation is recognized through the individual moods, as *laudas fulges sepis*. It is tracked down, however, in declension through the five tenses, which are manifest: for the path of declining a verb is tense. Often also it is tracked down in meter through feet, which are syllables: for with the number of syllables increasing, the meters of the verb are composed into verses, which we shall prove more plainly in declension.

*Affirmatio* is in one manner according to our people, when two verbs preside over one expression for the sake of affirming a sentence, according to that saying of Aeneas: "The Roman kings by equal and true sentence *credimus* and *fidimus*." It would suffice to say *credimus*, except that he wished to affirm the sentence. It is also affirmed by this state of speaking of the verb, when we say "*uenit* inquit uir." This is for affirmation only, for reasoning would have it thus: "*uenit* inquiens uir." But because if the indicative mood is doubled in one expression, they think they make a stronger sentence, therefore they put the verb *inquit* in the participial manner, but yet when it is placed below, it speaks first: for in inverted order of writing you thus say "*inquit* uenit."

*Inchogatio* is had in only one form of the verb, which form is called inchoative for this reason, that it does not have a preterite tense, as *calesco*. Although many of the Latins definitely affirm that no verb ought to exist which does not have a preterite tense. With whom I too would not refuse, since many verbs of this sort, which seem inchoative, are seen to have a preterite tense, except that verbs of the perfect form prevent them from coming into the opinion of those which more rightly claim the preterite tense for themselves. But when we have objected this to them, they responded that the preterite tense is accustomed to be common to verbs of twin *ordinatio*, as *floreo floresco*, and *florui* suits both. But because the authorities of our schools have never had this in use, leaving it in ambiguity, we shall bring forth the opinion of our teachers: that inchoative verbs always lack a preterite, except those which are similar to inchoatives, because they do not show themselves to have verbs from which they ought to be born: therefore they will have a preterite tense, as *conpisco conpiscui*, *cognosco cognoui*, *erubesco erubui*.

Now *praelatio* must be placed in its order. But what is *praelatio*, and how will it be understood without *postlatio*? *Praelatio*, therefore, consists in moods alone, when the indicative mood excels all others both in order and in force.

Now with these things completed, let us explain the only thing that remains: *declinatio*, namely, which is ready and well-trodden even for all schoolboys, even children. But according to poets it must be declined through meters and not according to grammarians through prose. And that syllables may seem to increase, let us decline a monosyllabic verb expanded according to the promise in *indagatio*. A neuter verb monosyllabically in the said indicative mood: *flo flamus*, *flas flatis*, *flabam flabamus*, *flant flate*, *fla fletis*, *flemus flatote*, *flem flato*, *fles flebo*, *flauere flare*. And that a more spacious example may be rendered to other verbs (because those things which have been left aside concerning this verb both prosaists and versifiers will be able to measure), let us extend even to disyllables, which are measured thus: *laudo*, *laudamus*, *laudatis*, *laudas*, *laudabamus*, *lauda*, *laudaui*, *laudasti*, *laudaueramus*, *lauda*, *laudemus*, *laudate*, *laudes*, *laudare*, *laudabimus*, *laudabitis*, *laudatu iri*, *laudans*, *laudantis*, *laudanti*, *laudaueritis*. We ought to know that trisyllabic verbs cannot be weighed so easily through these verses except by cutting. And therefore because the end of the letter is near, let us pass on to tetrasyllables, which are declined thus: *intellego*, *intellegis*, *intellegamus*, *intellegit*, *intellegunt*, *intelleguntur*. Each versifier ought to know and note that each *fonum* is counted in verse and meter as long for doubtful short syllables. Now, as we promised, let us finish the epistolary speech.

## Translator's Notes

### Grammatical Councils

The image of formal councils held at Rome to adjudicate grammatical disputes has no parallel in classical sources but resonates with ecclesiastical councils familiar from late antique and early medieval experience. The Council of Nicaea (325), Chalcedon (451), and subsequent synods established the model of authoritative assemblies resolving contested questions. By transposing this model to grammar, Virgilius implies that linguistic questions carry weight comparable to theological ones—a position consistent with his treatment of grammar as a quasi-sacred discipline.

### Reginus Cornilius and Hebrew

The portrait of Cornilius as fluent in Greek, Hebrew, and Latin places him in a tradition of trilingual Christian scholarship associated with Jerome and, later, with Irish monastic learning. The Irish church maintained unusual interest in Hebrew, visible in texts like the *Hisperica Famina* and various computistical works. Cornilius's role as Virgilius's teacher for one year—with rhetoric, poetry, and grammar taught in successive months—compresses the classical *trivium* into an impossibly intensive curriculum.

### The Verb as King

The analogy between the verb and a monarch, attributed to Cornilius, reflects early medieval political theology. Just as the king's mood determines the character of his rule (rigid or mild, warlike or peaceful), so the verb's mood determines the character of an utterance. This suggests a homology between grammatical and political order that pervades Insular Latin thought.

### The Twelve Parts of the Verb

Standard grammars treat the verb as one of eight parts of speech, with various "accidents" (mood, tense, person, etc.). Virgilius's twelve-part division is his own invention, creating a parallel to the twelve Latinities mentioned elsewhere. The specific terms mix standard grammatical vocabulary with novel technical usage.

### Origines Africanus and the Two Libraries

The story of Roman churches maintaining separate libraries for Christian and pagan philosophy has no historical foundation but reflects real late antique anxieties about pagan learning. The name "Origines Africanus" cleverly combines Origen (the Alexandrian theologian) with an African origin. The specification that he was "faithful except that he was a pagan" (*fidelis nisi quia gentilis erat*) is a paradox typical of Virgilius's humor.

### Frequentative Reduplication

The forms *uincinco*, *dicico*, *legego* are not Latin but Virgilian inventions, created by a kind of "stuttering" reduplication distinct from actual Latin frequentatives like *dictito*. Whether these represent actual experimental forms used in some Insular milieu, or pure invention for comic effect, remains debated.

### *Glifia*

The term *glifia* (possibly related to Greek γλυφή, "carving" or "riddle") for deliberate obscurity in writing reflects a well-documented feature of Insular Latin, especially in the *Hisperica Famina* and related texts. The explicit acknowledgment that writers obscure their meaning to "impede readers" or "incite their minds" suggests Virgilius is aware of—and perhaps defending—a recognized stylistic tradition.

### The Fifteen-Day Battle with Three Thousand Soldiers

The dispute between Regulus the Cappadocian and Sedulus the Roman escalates the earlier fourteen-day debate between Galbungus and Terrentius. The detail of three thousand soldiers on each side transforms grammatical controversy into military engagement. This may satirize the violence of ecclesiastical disputes or reflect the hyperbolic mode of Virgilian narrative.

### Lupus of Athens

The Christian teacher "Lupus of Athens" may reflect knowledge of Greek-speaking Christian communities, or may be purely invented. His advice—to accept what is agreed, reject what is discordant, and remain neutral on what is disputed—articulates a hermeneutic principle applicable beyond grammar to theology and philosophy.

### The Classification of *sum*

Virgilius's insistence (through Aeneas) that verbs not ending in *-o* belong to no conjugation represents genuine grammatical difficulty. The verb *sum* is anomalous in any classification system, and Virgilius's solution—to exclude it from the conjugational system entirely—is radical but internally consistent.

### Moods and the Six Ages

The correlation of six verbal moods with the six ages of the world (a scheme deriving from Augustine's *De catechizandis rudibus* and *De civitate Dei*) exemplifies the numerological thinking pervasive in early medieval exegesis.

### Chromas the Stoic and the Four Vowels

The Stoic Chromas who counts only four vowels (excluding *u*) represents a fusion of grammatical and philosophical numerology. His reasoning—that five has no "cardinal type" in Stoic calculation—is obscure but consistent with the kind of speculative number symbolism found in texts like Macrobius's *Saturnalia*.

### Twenty-Two Species and Hebrew

The correlation of twenty-two verbal species with the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet connects grammar to biblical numerology. This number also corresponds to the books of the Hebrew Bible in one ancient enumeration.

### Plastus's Poem on the Elements

The eight-line poem on the four elements is one of several verses attributed to invented authorities in Virgilius's works. The meter is accentual rather than quantitative, with consistent seven-syllable lines and end-rhyme—a form characteristic of early medieval Latin hymns rather than classical verse. The word *fristities* in the final line is obscure, possibly a coinage.

### Gemination for Euphony

The claim that poets write *aggo* for *ago*, *cellum* for *caelum*, *ollim* for *olim* for euphonic or metrical reasons has no basis in actual Latin practice. The verse cited ("laetaque aggunt in moenibus festa") appears to misquote or invent from Virgilian material. Such gemination may reflect Insular pronunciation or scribal practice.

### *Credo* as Oath

The semantic distinction between *credo* meaning "believe" and *credo* meaning "swear an oath" has no classical parallel. The examples from "Virgilius of the Trojan school" (writing against the Romans!) and Cato present *credere* and *discredere* as terms of oath-taking. This may reflect specialized vocabulary unknown from other sources, or pure invention.

### Metrical Paradigms

The chapter's conclusion, presenting verb forms arranged for verse composition, reflects the Irish practice of teaching grammar through verse, visible in texts like *Ars Malsachani*. The explicit instruction that schoolboys should learn declension "through meters and not through prose" inverts the classical priority of prose grammar over verse composition.
