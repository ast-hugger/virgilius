### English Translation

VIRGILIUS MARO TO JULIUS GERMANUS THE DEACON, GREETINGS.

In the histories of the Greeks we read that there was a certain prophet Tarquinius among the Persians, who used to impress upon tablets and little books whatever he had prophesied, until the event itself should prove it; when this was accomplished, he would publish his writings. Among these he prophesied a certain wondrous secret, which, because he did not yet see it fulfilled, he wished to show to no one until his death. But on nearly the very day on which he ended his life, he called one of his disciples, handing him a tablet and saying: "Alas for me, alas for me, O son, because these writings are not yet fulfilled! Happy and blessed will he be who shall have lived in those times in which these things that are contained in this vision shall be fulfilled." This vision was as follows. "I saw," said the prophet, "an immense river flowing from high heaven, and this river was wine. I also saw another stream flowing from the rocks of the earth, and this stream, when the brightness of the sun had risen, was carried up to meet the river falling from on high, and gathered into one the rivers became wine; and there was one river filling both channel and land, in which innumerable lambs and calves were playing, and drinking from it they sang the wedding-hymn in their drunkenness, and when their voice was heard, heaven and earth alike rejoiced."

This same prophecy now seems to have been fulfilled in these times, when that sun—not the temporal one, but the true and everlasting Son of God—having risen, that river of wine of heavenly Scripture flowed into all the earth, gladdening the heart of man, that is, of the whole human race. To this the stream of water—that is, of philosophy, that is, of little eloquence—which itself also became wine, was mingled with the heavenly Scripture. In this river calves and lambs play—that is, young men winged in their senses and rejoicing—and they sing the wedding-hymn fittingly and aptly as if to the melody of the lyre, setting forth the nuptial songs, that is, of the most serene banquets. When their voice is heard, heaven and earth—that is, spiritual and carnal men—rejoice and give thanks.

Of whom you are one, most welcome and most beloved brother Julius the deacon: intoxicated with the most delightful wine of divine Scripture and heavenly doctrine, you drink also this small stream of philosophical wisdom to such a degree that you have become not only the equal but even the predecessor of those who from the beginning of the founded world have flourished in philosophical eloquence and understanding. Whence, having searched through and read the books of all the philosophers, digesting all their controversies with a prudent and knowing heart, you have deigned to direct to me—as if to a judge and a most certain indicator of boundaries and roads—the most obscure and most difficult questions, investigated with diligent examination, through many letters: not because I am the most skilled of all, but because, as if to a companion and sharer of your faith and of one faith, you have more confidently thought to direct wondrous matters concerning questions of this kind.

Among these, a most weighty reason has settled in your mind: that concerning the eight parts of speech, in which very many questions are both perceived and read in a manner divided by most people, my particular diligence should be applied in explaining them. Whence I too, because the parts of speech are eight, arrange to set forth eight letters also, albeit in one volume: which I remember having done in the same manner of writing also in the volume of fifteen letters sent to Africa, to my boy Fabianus, most skilled and most teachable, then a pagan but now a believer purified by baptism.

Perhaps someone may wonder that in an unusual manner of letters I have composed the discourse of letters sent together only in the manner of a single letter under the title of a single little book. Whoever is moved by this fact, let him remember Lassius the most pure orator, who sent seventeen letters of interpretations at one time and with one pen to one and the same petitioner—not because that petitioner had requested that multitude of letters, but so that he might acquire both the relief of his own work and the convenience of readers, once the tedium of unchanging reading had been dispelled, as usually happens. For just as those who are about to measure long stretches of roads lighten their journey with certain limits and boundaries of stopping-places, tempering in a way the weariness of a long road, and reach the city or place to which they must go with less labor, so to speak—certain that they will not be able to complete the journey of so much time in a single day unless they have set down the burden of the laborious road through the lines of paths and certain modes of resting—so also those who, seizing upon an immense work of writing and about to compose their discourse concerning many matters and questions, temper their labor only by the frequent endings of completed books and the beginnings of those that follow, lest they produce tedium for themselves in writing and for readers in examining: so that a more renewed nature of the reader, having followed upon the alternations, might intercept the frequently divided little works of their books; they compose more elegantly and more eloquently the beginnings of words of things to be read anew, as if of another fresh work, for the kindling of the senses.

You have the *ogdoades*—the eight parts of speech—which I shall set forth in eight letters and send to you. It is yours, dearest brother, to help with your prayers unceasingly poured forth to the Lord, so that not only in the present work of discourse may He grant me opportunity—He who before all living things made man to speak rationally—but also in all my acts may He graciously bestow the measure of truth to be grasped and the rule of faith by which one ought to believe and beseech. This I do not doubt I shall obtain through your prayers, most holy minister of Christ: that you who in the one warfare of Christ hold the third grade of ecclesiastical dignity, may deign to entreat on behalf of my weakness that the unity of the divine substance co-eternally subsisting in three persons grant that I may obtain eternal mercy.

Farewell. Grace be with you.

## Translator's Notes

### The Genre of the Preface

The *Praefatio* follows the conventions of late antique epistolary dedications, but with characteristic Virgilian elaboration. The formal salutation (*VIRGILIUS MARO IULIO GERMANO DIACONO SALUTEM*) mirrors classical letter openings, while the extended allegorical narrative that follows transforms a simple dedication into something approaching a prose hymn. Vivien Law (1995) has noted that this preface sets the tone for the entire *Epistolae*: ostensibly practical grammatical instruction wrapped in visionary, quasi-mystical rhetoric.

### Tarquinius the Prophet

The prophet "Tarquinius among the Persians" (*Tarquinium con Persas*) is otherwise unknown. The name evokes the Roman Tarquins, particularly Tarquinius Superbus who consulted the Sibylline Books, but the Persian setting suggests a different tradition—perhaps evoking the Magi or Zoroastrian priests. Michael Herren (1979) suggested this might reflect knowledge of Eastern prophetic traditions mediated through late antique compilations.

The detail that Tarquinius withheld his prophecy until near death, then entrusted it to a disciple, parallels the transmission of esoteric knowledge in various ancient traditions. Law (1995) connects this to the theme of hidden wisdom that pervades Virgilius's works.

### The Vision: Wine, Water, and Wedding Songs

The vision of Tarquinius is rich with biblical and classical imagery woven together. The river of wine flowing from heaven recalls both the miracle at Cana (John 2:1-11) and the eschatological imagery of Joel 3:18, where "the mountains shall drip sweet wine." The stream rising from earth's rocks evokes Moses striking the rock in the wilderness (Exodus 17:6, Numbers 20:11), a common typological image for Christ in patristic exegesis. The lambs and calves playing together draw on biblical pastoral imagery such as Isaiah 11:6, "the calf and the lion and the fatling together."

The *epithalamion*—the Greek term for a wedding hymn—connects the vision to the Song of Songs tradition and the mystical marriage of Christ and the Church, a standard patristic interpretation. The rejoicing of heaven and earth together echoes Psalm 96:11, "Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad."

The fusion of a pagan prophetic frame (Tarquinius among the Persians) with Christian content (the Son of God, Scripture, baptism) is characteristic of Virgilius's synthetic approach to learning and revelation.

### The Allegorical Interpretation

Virgilius provides his own allegoresis of the vision, systematically decoding each element. The rising sun represents the Son of God, playing on the Latin near-homophony of *sol* (sun) and the theological title. The river of wine signifies heavenly Scripture, while the stream rising from earth stands for philosophy or, as Virgilius diminutively calls it, "little eloquence" (*eloquentiola*). The lambs and calves playing in the mingled waters are young men or students, "winged in their senses" and rejoicing. Their wedding hymn becomes the songs of serene banquets, and heaven and earth rejoicing together are decoded as spiritual and carnal men giving thanks.

The diminutive *eloquentiola* for philosophy is notable—it subordinates secular learning to divine Scripture while still granting it a place in the mingled stream. Di Maggio (2021) sees this as reflecting the standard early medieval hierarchy of *sacra pagina* over *artes liberales*.

### Julius Germanus the Deacon

The addressee holds "the third grade of ecclesiastical dignity" (*tertium ecclesiasticae dignitatis gradum*), which in the standard cursus of major orders means the diaconate (after bishop and priest). The name "Germanus" was common in both Gaul and Ireland in this period; a "Julius" is not otherwise attested as a correspondent of Virgilius.

The extravagant praise of Julius—that he surpasses all philosophers since the foundation of the world—is conventional *captatio benevolentiae* pushed to Virgilian extremes. Whether Julius was a real person or a literary fiction remains debated; Herren (1995) inclines toward the latter.

### *Gnoto corde*

The phrase *gnoto corde* ("with a knowing heart") uses the archaic/poetic adjective *gnotus* for classical *gnarus* (knowing, skilled). Huemer's apparatus notes that the manuscript has *ignoto* ("unknowing"), which some editors prefer, reading ironically. The form *gnotus* appears elsewhere in Virgilius and may be a deliberate archaism or Insular Latin feature.

### The Lost African Letters

Virgilius mentions a previous work: "fifteen letters sent to Africa" (*XV epistolarum Africam missarum uolumine*) addressed to Fabianus, whom he describes as "my boy" (*puerum meum*)—evidently a student or young protégé—and praises as "most skilled and most teachable" (*peritissimum ac docillimum*). Most intriguingly, Fabianus was "then a pagan, but now a believer purified by baptism" (*tunc gentilem, nunc autem fidelem baptismate purificatum*), suggesting that Virgilius's grammatical instruction played some role in his conversion or formation as a Christian.

This work does not survive. The reference to Africa has prompted speculation about Virgilius's connections to North Africa, though "Africa" in this period typically meant the former Roman province (roughly modern Tunisia). Bischoff (1988) connected this to possible Visigothic Spanish networks that extended to North Africa.

The number fifteen may parallel the fifteen *Epitomae* that form Virgilius's other major work, suggesting a deliberate numerological structure across his literary output.

### Lassius the Orator

The example of "Lassius the most pure orator" (*Lassii purissimi oratoris*) who wrote seventeen letters of interpretations is another Virgilian invention. The name may pun on *lassus* (weary), appropriate for the extended metaphor about journey-weariness that follows. No such orator is known from any other source.

The justification for dividing one work into multiple letters—that it provides rest-stops for both writer and reader—is a clever rhetorical move. It acknowledges the artificial nature of the letter-divisions while defending them on practical grounds.

### The Journey Metaphor

The extended simile comparing the division of a literary work to breaking up a journey with *mansiones* (stopping-places, way-stations) reflects the realities of late antique and early medieval travel. The Roman *cursus publicus* had established *mansiones* at regular intervals; the term was also used for stages of spiritual progress in monastic literature.

The vocabulary is notable: Virgilius speaks of *callium lineas* ("lines of paths," where the *callis* is a narrow mountain path), *requietionum modos* ("modes of resting"), and uses the rare verb *intercapitant* meaning "to interrupt" or "break up." This precise and somewhat unusual diction is characteristic of his style throughout the *Epistolae*.

### *Ogdoades*

The Greek term *ogdoades* (ὀγδοάδες, "groups of eight" or simply "the eight") for the eight parts of speech is a learned flourish. In Gnostic and Neoplatonic systems, the Ogdoad referred to a group of eight divine beings or spheres. Whether Virgilius intends any esoteric resonance or simply displays Greek learning is unclear. Law (1995) sees possible connections to numerological traditions.

### The Eight Parts of Speech

The eight parts of speech in the Latin grammatical tradition, following Donatus, are the *nomen* (noun), *pronomen* (pronoun), *verbum* (verb), *adverbium* (adverb), *participium* (participle), *coniunctio* (conjunction), *praepositio* (preposition), and *interiectio* (interjection). The *Epistolae* as they survive treat each of these in turn, though the letters vary considerably in length.

### The Trinitarian Closing

The final prayer is explicitly Trinitarian: Julius is asked to pray that Virgilius may obtain mercy from "the unity of the divine substance co-eternally subsisting in three persons" (*in tribus diuinae unitatem substantiae personis coaeternaliter subsistentem*). This formula reflects post-Nicene orthodoxy and the terminology of the *Quicumque vult* (Athanasian Creed).

The phrase *in una Christi militia* ("in the one warfare of Christ") uses military imagery common in early Christian literature (cf. 2 Timothy 2:3-4, "the good soldier of Christ Jesus").

### The Closing Formula

*Uale. Gratia tecum.* ("Farewell. Grace be with you.") combines the classical epistolary closing (*uale*) with the Pauline greeting (*gratia tecum/vobiscum*, cf. Romans 16:20, etc.). This fusion of classical and Christian epistolary conventions is typical of late antique Christian letters.

### Authenticity and Purpose

The *Praefatio* raises the central interpretive question about Virgilius's work: is this elaborate machinery—the Persian prophet, the allegorical vision, the invented authorities—serious religious teaching, learned parody, or something in between?

Several scholars have noted that the preface functions as a kind of hermeneutic key: it tells the reader to expect hidden meanings, to look beneath the surface of the text. The vision that must be "interpreted" (*interpretatio*) models the reading practice Virgilius expects from his audience. Whether the grammatical content that follows rewards such deep reading remains a matter of scholarly debate.

What is clear is that Virgilius positions grammar itself as a form of sacred knowledge, continuous with scriptural wisdom. The "small stream" of philosophy joins the "river" of Scripture; the grammatical *Epistolae* participate in the same cosmic drama as Tarquinius's prophecy. This sacralization of grammar—making the study of language a spiritual discipline—may be Virgilius's most distinctive contribution to the medieval tradition.
