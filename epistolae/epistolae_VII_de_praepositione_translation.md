# THE LETTERS OF VIRGILIUS MARO
## VII. ON THE PREPOSITION

### English Translation

The seventh letter must be begun by me concerning the preposition. But because the customary discourse concerning customary prepositions is almost for the boys of philosophers, therefore let us take up unusual prepositions from the fourth kind of philosophical Latinity, knowing this first, that monosyllabic prepositions have no other kind besides the customary, such as *a*, *ad*, *e*, *de*, *ex*, *pro*, *prae*, *cis*, *post*, *trans*, *in*, *sub*, *cum*, *clam*. These are held in no experienced Latinity which we use at all.

I shall give therefore the prepositions of the accusative case:

- *con* for *apud* [at, among]
- *salion* for *ante* [before]
- *cyron* for *aduersus* or *contra* [against]
- *trasso* for *citra* [on this side of]
- *matyrion* for *circa* [around]
- *rectim* for *erga* [toward]
- *statuim* for *pone* [behind]
- *relas* for *prope* [near]
- *farax* for *secundum* [according to]
- *longeon* for *ultra* [beyond]
- *sarium* for *praeter* [besides]
- *sepelum* for *supra* [above]
- *gabil* for *usque ad* [all the way to]
- *caom* for *penes* [in the possession of]
- *liuim* for *iuxta* [next to]
- *leuim* for *secus* [beside]

Now the prepositions of the ablative case:

- *respon* for *coram* [in the presence of]
- *aspon* for *palam* [openly]
- *peripsa* for *sine* [without]
- *absit* for *absque* [without]
- *aram* for *tenus* [up to]

Likewise those common to both cases:

- *padon* for *super* [over]
- *lindon* for *subter* [beneath]
- *madus* for *subtus* [under]

Now unless it is troublesome, so that these things which are gradually becoming obscure may shine forth, let us give examples from the elders. Behold, a certain Andrianus speaks, a man quite learned in solving problems: "*Con tecta numande iubelos soni et laetitiae*." This is to say "among the inhabitants of dwellings." Glengus also, that father of our Maximianus, in his exposition made concerning the gods, thus began: "*Salion solem dii erant*," that is "before the sun." The same man was also rich in Latinity, and introduced in another place: "*Sepelum pereneum uissere montem*," that is "above the mountain." Galbungus also in a certain letter written to Assianus Gurgilius: "The height," he says, "of your eloquence *gabil* has reached the heavens," that is "all the way to the heavens." I also once said: "*Bellatis cyron me*," that is "against me."

The accents of these prepositions are not so much subtle in verse as necessary for concealing mysteries and for the experience of teaching this Latinity. Let these things said about unusual prepositions suffice; now let us return to our own which are always in use.

No preposition ought to have ended in *d*, except that necessity compels us to transgress the decrees of the elders for the sake of distinguishing words at least. For because it is most certain that an adverb or conjunction ends in *t*, such as *at*, we are compelled to write *d* in the preposition. For *at* is sometimes an adverb of present time, according to that Virgilian saying: "*At pergite ad proeliandum*," that is "now proceed." But *aput* ought always to be written with *t*: but because *apud* is written as a neuter noun, namely of that wood by which whatever things are to be pounded or thrust into the earth are struck, therefore we are accustomed to write *aput* with *d*.

Between *cis* and *citra* there is this difference, that *cis* pertains to a nearer place with at least a mountain or river interposed, but *citra* pertains to a farther place, whence also *citeriora* [nearer things] and *longiora* [farther things] are spoken. But *trans* can be referred to both, although changeably, that is, it is taken thus only in transit. For whoever dare to write or even say that some people "lived across the sea," they speak not only incautiously but most badly and perversely. For thus one ought to begin a sentence, so that it is said "they go across the sea" or "they come"; but "they dwell on this side of the sea" or "nearer."

Between *ultra* and *citra* there is no small difference: for *citra* can be said even with a mountain or river interposed; but *ultra* is always referred to the farthest or most remote places or deserts.

Between *absque* and *sine* the ancients placed this distinction, that *sine* they always bore in a good sense, but *absque* in a bad sense, as "without sin," "lacking wisdom." But this observance has been confused on both sides. But it is not sufficiently certain whether each can be said in each manner, or rather whether the order and reasoning of words have been mixed up by the error of scribes. This at least is given to be understood by all who read rightly, that *sine* by unchangeable reasoning is referred to that which is utterly not present in any thing; but *absque* pertains to a double sense, either of that thing which someone lacks entirely, as it is customarily said "animals are without intellect," certainly not having intellect: or of that thing, with which excepted the rest are either obscured or denied, or even of that thing with which at the same time some things are claimed.

There are many examples of this matter, according to that which I also had made last year, when I published a commentary book on the creation of the world against the pagans, whose beginning is: "*Absque deo nullus est solus, qui omnia creat*" [Without God there is no one alone, who creates all things]. Here obscuration and negation are contained at the same time, and also praise: for all gods who are so called are obscured and denied, and God alone of all is praised. *Praeter* also has this sense, according to that saying "no one is wise besides you."

But in that which a certain Andreas wrote concerning Pyrrhus: "*Absque Asiae*" he says "*uiribus, in comitatibus habuit X milia*," this is to say "with the forces of Asia" [i.e., not counting the forces of Asia, he had ten thousand in his retinue].

*Tenus* is called by many a *subpositio* [postposition], because it is subjoined, as we say "*nocte tenus*" [up to night]. And compounded it renders from itself a causal conjunction, as "*quatenus dicat*," that is "until he speaks."

*Ante* also has a double sense: for it is said either concerning priority of time, as that saying "it was before the ages"; or it is also taken for *coram* [in the presence of], as that saying: "He sat before the tribunal," that is "in the presence of the tribunal."

What the difference is between *circum* and *circa* and *erga* was explained by us previously. And so let these things briefly spoken concerning prepositions suffice.

## Translator's Notes

### The Fourth Latinity

This chapter offers the most sustained glimpse into Virgilius's system of twelve *Latinitates* or kinds of Latin. In the *Epitomae*, he names these twelve varieties and associates them with different rhetorical registers and purposes. Here the "fourth kind of philosophical Latinity" (*quartum philosophiae latinitatis genus*) provides an entire alternative vocabulary of prepositions. The dismissal of ordinary prepositions as fit only for "boys of philosophers" (*pueris philosophorum*) sets up the esoteric alternative.

### The Invented Prepositions

The list of exotic prepositions is perhaps the most famous passage in Virgilius's work, and the one that has generated the most scholarly debate. The forms have no parallels in any known language:

**Accusative prepositions**: *con*, *salion*, *cyron*, *trasso*, *matyrion*, *rectim*, *statuim*, *relas*, *farax*, *longeon*, *sarium*, *sepelum*, *gabil*, *caom*, *liuim*, *leuim*

**Ablative prepositions**: *respon*, *aspon*, *peripsa*, *absit*, *aram*

**Common prepositions**: *padon*, *lindon*, *madus*

Some scholars have attempted to find Celtic, Hebrew, or Greek etymologies for these words. Herren (1979) noted possible Irish elements in some forms, while others have suggested they are pure inventions or deliberate nonsense. A few show possible derivations: *peripsa* might echo Greek *περί* (around) + *ἄψ* (back); *longeon* contains Latin *longus*; *sepelum* may relate to *super*. But most resist explanation.

### Purpose: Concealing Mysteries

Virgilius explicitly states that these prepositions are used "for concealing mysteries" (*propter tegenda misteria*). This connects to the broader tradition of *glifia* or deliberately obscure language discussed in the *Epitomae*. Whether this represents actual cryptographic practice, pedagogical game, literary parody, or mystical concealment remains debated. The Irish tradition of *Hisperic* Latin, with its deliberately exotic vocabulary, provides the closest parallel.

### The Scholars Cited

The examples come from Virgilius's usual cast of invented authorities:

- **Andrianus**: "a man quite learned in solving problems" (*problismata*)—the Greek loanword suggests philosophical or mathematical puzzles
- **Glengus**: identified as "father of our Maximianus," placing him in a genealogy of teachers; his "exposition concerning the gods" (*expositio de diis*) suggests mythological or theological commentary
- **Galbungus**: writing to "Assianus Gurgilius," another invented correspondent
- **Virgilius himself**: unusually, he provides his own example (*bellatis cyron me*)

### Andrianus's Sentence

The quoted sentence "*Con tecta numande iubelos soni et laetitiae*" is almost entirely opaque. Beyond *con* (= *apud*), the words *numande*, *iubelos*, and *soni* (if not genitive of *sonus*) have no clear meaning. Virgilius's gloss "among the inhabitants of dwellings" suggests *tecta* means "dwellings" (its classical sense) and *numande* might relate to inhabitants, but the full syntax remains mysterious.

### The *Ad/At* and *Aput/Apud* Distinctions

Returning to ordinary prepositions, Virgilius offers folk-etymological explanations for orthographic choices:

- *Ad* ends in *d* to distinguish it from the adverb/conjunction *at* (which ends in *t*)
- *Aput* "ought" to end in *t*, but is written *apud* with *d* to distinguish it from a supposed neuter noun *apud* meaning a wooden implement for pounding

The second explanation is entirely invented—no such noun *apud* exists. This exemplifies Virgilius's technique of creating grammatical rules through fictional etymology.

### *Trans* for Motion Only

The insistence that *trans* can only be used for motion, never habitation ("they go across the sea" but not "they lived across the sea"), reflects genuine classical usage more strictly than late Latin practice allowed. Virgilius's vehemence ("not only incautiously but most badly and perversely") suggests this was a real point of contention in his milieu.

### *Sine* versus *Absque*

The claimed distinction—*sine* for positive contexts ("without sin"), *absque* for negative ("lacking wisdom")—has no basis in classical usage, where the words are largely synonymous. Virgilius acknowledges the distinction has been "confused on both sides" (*utrimque confusum*), effectively admitting it may never have existed. His more elaborate semantic analysis of *absque* as involving either total lack or exception shows genuine philosophical subtlety.

### Virgilius's Anti-Pagan Commentary

The autobiographical reference to writing "last year" (*hesterno anno*) a commentary on creation "against the pagans" (*aduersus paganos*) is rare and valuable. The opening line quoted—"*Absque deo nullus est solus, qui omnia creat*"—is theologically orthodox monotheism, denying all other gods while praising the one Creator. This confirms Virgilius's Christian context and suggests he wrote works beyond the grammatical treatises that survive.

### Andreas on Pyrrhus

The quotation about Pyrrhus (presumably the Epirote king who fought Rome) using *absque* to mean "not counting" or "in addition to" shows the preposition's semantic range. "*Absque Asiae uiribus, in comitatibus habuit X milia*" means that besides (or not counting) Asian forces, Pyrrhus had ten thousand in his retinue. This "exclusive" sense of *absque* parallels English "without" in phrases like "without the tip, the bill was fifty dollars."

### *Tenus* as Postposition

The observation that *tenus* (up to, as far as) is called a *subpositio* because it follows its noun (*nocte tenus*, not *tenus nocte*) shows awareness of Latin's one genuine postposition. The compound *quatenus* (to what extent, insofar as) is correctly derived.

### Cross-Reference to Earlier Work

The closing reference to *circum*, *circa*, and *erga* having been "explained by us previously" (*a nobis pridem... ante expositum est*) points to discussion elsewhere, presumably in the *Epitomae* or an earlier letter. Such cross-references create the impression of a vast interconnected scholarly corpus.

### Brevity

Like several of the later *Epistolae*, this chapter is relatively brief, focusing on the spectacular list of invented prepositions before returning to more pedestrian distinctions. The promise to treat prepositions "briefly" (*breuiter*) is kept, though the exotic vocabulary ensures memorability.
