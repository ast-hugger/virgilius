# IV. ON THE ADVERB

Every city that is fortified and encircled does not surrender its citizens to enemies: so too a historical exposition, if it has been properly ordered correctly and rationally, will have no further occasion for criticism. Whence our teachers advise us that all arts—not only the principal ones, but also the intermediate and auxiliary—should be correctly established in their precepts. On account of which I also, since I have conveyed to you brief expositions concerning the noun and pronoun and verb through letters, will explain the lesser parts as well in briefer but proper letters, especially since in the *Epitomae* I made one small work concerning the four parts which remain, namely adverb, participle, conjunction, and preposition. If these have their own proper letters, something a little more ample will be conferred upon readers for understanding.

The adverb, therefore, is the fourth particle of speech, which because it adheres to the verb is called *aduerbium*, just as the pronoun is called from its sharing with the noun. But here a question arises. For perhaps someone may inquire—which I do not doubt will happen—if the adverb is so called because it is always joined to the verb, by what name will be called adverbs of comparison or of quality and quantity, which sometimes are joined not only to verbs but to other parts of speech? For we say "*magna ualde uenit turba*" [a very great crowd came]. Could you possibly arrange it thus: "*uenit ualde*"? Otherwise how will the sentence be understood? We also say "*tam docti*" [so learned] and "*tam ueloces*" [so swift]. Whence also those who wish to enumerate not eight but more parts of speech divide the adverb into two parts, calling one by the ancient name "adverb," the other *expressorium* [expressive]. For indeed adverbs which we apply to nouns or to other adverbs signify not so much the customary adjunction as the expression of meanings. An adverb adhering to an adverb without any comparison will pertain only to affirmation, as *tam digne* [so worthily] and *ualde uiriliter* [very manfully] and *satis pulcre* [sufficiently beautifully]. Whence they err not a little who also interpose a copulative conjunction, so that it becomes "*satis et pulchre*" [sufficiently and beautifully].

The signification of adverbs is manifold. But many think that no adverbs can be born from themselves: for when you say *seorsum*, an adverb of separating, you have a noun from which it is born, which is *seurus*, that is, one who separates himself from human society: just as also *adorus*, one who presents himself to the faces of all, according to that saying of Cicero: "If I shall have been skilled, I shall make myself *adorum* [conspicuous] to all; but otherwise, I shall become *seurus* [withdrawn], fearing to deliver myself to the assemblies of the skilled." *Simul*, an adverb of gathering, is also born from *similitudo* [likeness].

Many press upon us a question: how do derived nouns seem to come from adverbs, as *heri* [yesterday], from which comes *hesternus* [of yesterday]; *hodie* [today], whence *hodiernus* [of today]; *cras* [tomorrow], whence *crastinus* [of tomorrow]; for adverbs ought rather to be born from nouns. I remember consulting Aeneas about this, who responded to me that unless established custom had handed down these as temporal adverbs, they would rather be believed to be temporal nouns and *monoptota* [indeclinables], from which these derivatives would be born. And lest he seem to put forth his own opinion, he asserted that he had learned this from a certain old teacher Julius, who added this: that because these nouns do not have declension, therefore they are thought to be adverbs by the ignorant; just as also *nequam* [worthless] and *nugas* [trifles] are reckoned by very many to be adverbs of quality on account of the defect of declension. "But this," he said, "will not please the Romans, because they are more accustomed to consent to obstinate custom than to certain reason."

There are also adverbs whose origin is ambiguous, such as *frustra* [in vain], *nequiquam* [to no purpose], *nequiter* [wickedly]. For whether *frustra* comes from an original noun, or from the imperative mood of a common verb, still hangs in the choice of readers. But *nequiquam* and *nequiter*—both come from *nequam*, as it seems to many of the Latins; this alone moves most people: whether adverbs in *-ter*, unless from the ablative case of an adjective noun terminated in the letter *-e*, can come at all; which because they do not have as certain, they utterly reject *nequiter*. But to us *nequiquam* seems to be one thing, *nequiter* another: for *nequiquam* is understood as "without cause" or "in vain," but *nequiter* advances toward something worse. Many also ask why *qui* is placed in the middle, so that *nequiquam* is read instead of *nequam*, when *nequam* can also be taken adverbially just as in every case, gender, and number. But this addition of a middle syllable was adopted only for the sake of distinction. For the rest, let them either take *nequiter* simply from *nequam*, or understand it to be born from itself, because they have no other option; or if they prefer, let them reject it entirely.

They also inquire whether adverbs can be born from participles; and if they can, from which participle, whether from all or from some. I promise indeed that I shall profess even openly to all the skilled of the world that adverbs undoubtedly come from participles. But if it is asked from which participle, I shall say as I have learned by experience: that adverbs are taken from the participle of the present tense of common gender, and from the participle of the past tense of any verb. But from the two future participles, no one among the skilled is proven to have taken adverbs; for we say *docenter* [learnedly], *sapienter* [wisely], *instanter* [urgently], *perseueranter* [perseveringly], although according to Galbungus it is denied that an adverb is taken from the participle of the present tense of an active verb, but is rather drawn from the participle of a neutral verb. Moreover, the same teacher denies that adverbs come from the participles of common and deponent verbs except viciously, so that in the past tense according to the threefold signification—passive, common, and deponent—no one among the skilled can deny that adverbs come: since indeed we say *docte* [learnedly], *osculate* [kissingly], *suspicate* [suspectingly], *locute* [speakingly]. Yet I have heard that in the schools of the Africans it is frequently said that from the participles of deponent verbs, especially those which do not have the habit of acting, adverbs are not accustomed to be born.

Since these things are so, with the attentive ambiguity of teachers who seem to disagree among themselves, we must take counsel that we take up in a settled and definite manner those things which are doubted by no one, that is, that we always take adverbs from the participle of the present tense of a neutral verb and from that which is of a passive and common verb, at least of the past tenses, as is *perseueranter*, *firmate* [firmly], *scrutate* [searchingly]. According to this rule also in the comparison and superlative of participles, the reasoning of adverbs will likewise be preserved.

But adverbs which end in the syllable *-im* are not taken from one origin. For some of them come from derived nouns, as *caelestim* [heavenly], *furtim* [stealthily]. Some are born from possessive pronouns, as *meatim* [in my manner], *nostratim* [in our manner]. Some also from participles of the passive verb, as *strictim* [briefly], *singillatim* [singly]: for *singillo* [I single out] is commonly read, according to that saying of Dominus, a most eloquent and modest man, who says: "It is no moderate or easy task to *singillare* [single out] good from evil." Some also suspect that adverbs come from primary nouns, as *partim* [partly], which is said from *pars* [part], and *uoluntatim* [willingly] from *uoluntas* [will].

What now? Because I think I have said enough somewhere about adverbs, the speech must be shortened; before whose end I must recall that saying of Aeneas, when I asked him whether adverbs can be compounded, just as the other parts of speech. Thus he responded to me: "Why do you ask me what is well-worn? For adverbs have two rules of composition; the first, which is understood according to the part from which it comes, as *edocte* [learnedly], *indocte* [unlearnedly], *insipienter* [unwisely], *inepte* [ineptly], *reprobate* [reprovingly], *appense* [weighingly]: the second, which is placed subjunctively in local adverbs; the cause of this will be when another local adverb has preceded in any writing. Then you say *ibidem* [in the same place], just as this custom is also found very often in pronouns, when with the person of anyone having been spoken before, in the continuing speech one says *idem* [the same] or *eadem* [the same]. There is also an adverb similar to the ablative case of a pronoun, as *illo* [there]: for we often say '*illo* exibimus' [we shall go out there], that is *illuc*. So also *quo* [whither], when we say '*quo* uadunt' [whither do they go]. But these adverbs are always mobile."

Because with these things said, the above-mentioned Aeneas finished his speech, for me also writing this letter, here an end must be placed.

## Translator's Notes

### The Fortified City

The opening metaphor comparing a well-ordered grammatical exposition to a fortified city that protects its citizens belongs to a tradition of military imagery in late antique rhetoric. Augustine uses similar fortification metaphors in the *De doctrina Christiana*, and the image resonates with the walled monastery as a space of ordered learning. The phrase *ratabunde* (rationally, reasonably) is rare and may be a Virgilian coinage.

### The *Expressorium*

The division of adverbs into traditional *aduerbia* (which modify verbs) and *expressoria* (which intensify nouns or other adverbs) represents a genuine grammatical insight dressed in Virgilian terminology. The problem of adverbs that modify adjectives rather than verbs was recognized by classical grammarians, though none proposed this particular solution. The term *expressorium* appears to be Virgilius's invention, formed on the model of other grammatical terms in *-orium*.

### *Seurus* and *Adorus*

These invented adjectives exemplify Virgilius's technique of reverse etymology. Instead of deriving adverbs from existing words, he invents base words to explain adverbs:

- *seurus* (one who separates himself) → *seorsum* (separately)
- *adorus* (one who presents himself to faces) → from *ad* + *ora* (to mouths/faces)

The quotation from "Cicero" about becoming either *adorum* or *seurus* depending on one's skill is characteristically Virgilian pseudo-citation. The sentiment—that the learned display themselves while the ignorant hide—parodies philosophical commonplaces about wisdom and society.

### Julius the Elder

The old teacher Julius, cited through Aeneas, adds another layer to Virgilius's chain of authorities. His observation that indeclinable words are mistaken for adverbs by the ignorant contains genuine grammatical insight: Latin does have indeclinable nouns (*fas*, *nefas*, *nihil*) that could theoretically serve as the bases for derived adjectives. The critique that Romans prefer "obstinate custom to certain reason" (*obstinatae consuetudini quam certae rationi*) is a recurring theme in Virgilius's work, reflecting tensions between grammatical prescription and linguistic reality.

### The Problem of *Nequiter*

The discussion of whether *nequiter* is legitimate reflects real uncertainty in Latin grammar. Adverbs in *-ter* typically derive from third-declension adjectives via the ablative (e.g., *fortis* → *forti* → *fortiter*). But *nequam* is indeclinable, raising the question of how *nequiter* could be formed. Virgilius's solution—that it either comes directly from *nequam* or "is born from itself"—acknowledges the anomaly while refusing to reject the form entirely.

### Adverbs from Participles

The discussion of participial adverbs (*docenter*, *sapienter*, *osculate*, *locute*) engages with standard grammatical teaching. Present participial adverbs in *-nter* (from *-ns*, *-ntis* participles) and perfect participial adverbs in *-e* (from *-tus*, *-ta*, *-tum* participles) are well-attested in classical Latin. Virgilius's examples *osculate* and *locute* (from deponent verbs *osculor* and *loquor*) push into less common territory, and his report that African schools disputed such forms may reflect real regional variation in late Latin usage.

### The Schools of the Africans

The reference to *Afrorum scolas* (schools of the Africans) is one of several geographical markers in Virgilius's work. Whether this reflects actual knowledge of North African grammatical traditions, or is simply local color for his invented scholarly landscape, remains debated. North Africa did have a vigorous Latin grammatical tradition through figures like Pompeius and Priscian's teachers, making the reference plausible.

### Adverbs in *-im*

The list of adverbs ending in *-im* includes both genuine Latin forms (*furtim*, *strictim*, *singillatim*, *partim*) and apparent inventions:

- *caelestim* (unattested; classical Latin uses *caelitus*)
- *meatim*, *nostratim* (unattested; formed as if from possessive pronouns)
- *uoluntatim* (unattested)

The verb *singillo* (I single out), cited from "Dominus" (perhaps Donatus, as Mai conjectured), is extremely rare if not invented. The quotation about singling out good from evil has a moralizing tone appropriate to a Christian context.

### Compound Adverbs

Aeneas's two rules for compound adverbs—prefixation (*in-*, *e-*, *re-*, *ap-*) and subjunctive local sequence (*ibidem* following another locative)—represent reasonable grammatical observations. The comparison to pronouns (*idem*, *eadem* referring back to previously mentioned persons) shows sophisticated understanding of anaphora and deixis.

### Mobile Adverbs

The final category of "mobile adverbs" (*aduerbia mobilia*) refers to forms like *illo* and *quo* that resemble ablative case forms of pronouns but function as adverbs of place. This morphological ambiguity between case forms and adverbs was a genuine feature of Latin that grammarians discussed. Virgilius's term *mobilia* (mobile, changeable) captures their flexibility.

### The Brevity of this Letter

This is the shortest of the *Epistolae*, and Virgilius explicitly acknowledges its brevity, noting that he has already treated adverbs in the *Epitomae*. The chapter serves almost as an appendix, adding refinements to earlier discussions rather than providing comprehensive treatment. The abrupt ending—breaking off when Aeneas stops speaking—is characteristic of Virgilius's epistolary style.
