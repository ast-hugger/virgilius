## Epitomae

### I. [De Sapientia]() ✤ [On Wisdom]()

Virgilius establishes that philosophy must serve Hebrew scripture, never supplanting
divine law with human eloquence. He presents wisdom as twofold—earthly and
celestial—mirrored in the human constitution of body and soul. The doctrine of twelve
Latinities appears, suggesting language has esoteric dimensions beyond common usage.
Teacher Aeneas and "the ancestors" are first introduced as authorities.

### II. [De Litera]() ✤ [On the Letter]()

Aeneas teaches that the letter grows like a human being: infant, child, adolescent, youth,
mature adult. Letters possess body (visible shape), soul (grammatical function), and
celestial fire (higher contemplation). Virgilius introduces "Bigerran speech"—a mysterious
regional or invented dialect. The chapter concludes with an elaborate numerological system
assigning values to letters.

### III. [De Syllaba]() ✤ [On the Syllable]()

A brief transitional chapter. Virgilius calls vowels "queens of letters" and syllables
their "glue." He defers to Terrentius, who treated syllable computation "most fully,"
adding only what was left out. Syllables receive numerical values in a cryptic system
(*al* = 800, *bpa* = 3000). The chapter serves as "a little preface" to the treatment of
meters.

### IV. [De Metris]() ✤ [On Meters]()

The longest and most digressive chapter. Virgilius surveys philosophy (poetry, rhetoric,
grammar, *leporia*, dialectic, geometry, astronomy), attacks mendacious rhetoricians, and
describes humans as a "lesser world" (*mundus minor*) containing all cosmic elements. He
criticizes grammarian Honoratus for errors and provides alternative astrological
sign-names. Philosophy must ascend from *physica* through *ethica* to *logica*.


### V. [De Nomine]() ✤ [On the Noun]()

Aeneas argues that nouns precede verbs because children receive names before acting.
Virgilius discusses naming practices: his uncle Samminius was called *Goelanus*
("delightful") by his mother. Hebrew *res* (the letter ר meaning "head") proves nouns are
primary. The chapter weeps for Aeneas's "long absence," suggesting his death. Cicero is
quoted on diminutives "from sense, not from letter."

### VI. [De Pronomine]() ✤ [On the Pronoun]()

Some grammarians reduce eight parts of speech to five. Virgilius presents elaborate
invented pronouns (*mus*, *helus*) and defective paradigms. Blessed Aeneas teaches proper
word order through poetic examples: "The sun in heaven shines, a ray." Homer is quoted
composing Latin verses about a wealthy king and his goddess-spouse. *Ille* should refer
only to superior persons.

### VII. [De Verbo]() ✤ [On the Verb]()

Virgilius recalls attending a gathering of thirty grammarians who debated the verb's
primacy. He studied under Aeneas for years, also learning from Gratianus (ten years) and
Galbungus. The verb derives from *uerbere* (blow) and *bucino* (trumpet)—tongue striking
throat, voice trumpeting. Cato, Aeneas, and Cicero dispute whether imperative or
indicative mood has priority.

### VIII. [De Reliquis Partibus]() ✤ [On the Remaining Parts]()

Five minor parts compressed into one chapter. Invented adverbs (*tun*, *con*, *tuncon*)
appear. Aeneas describes the sun fleeing into the sea "as into a most fortified city" in
disgust at human discord. Virgilius Assianus uses *ergo* for "often." Interjections are
dismissed as "almost superfluous." The teacher Origines Atheniensis corrected young
Virgilius on spelling.

### XIII. [De Scinderatione Fonorum]() ✤ [On Word-Splitting]()

Aeneas gives three reasons to split words: testing students' sharpness, beautifying
eloquence, and hiding mysteries "lest pigs trample gems." Letter-puzzles are presented
(Cicero's SPES ROMANORVM PERIT). Aeneas tearfully narrates the "Mithridatic War"—a garbled
apocalyptic history involving Blastus the Phrygian savage and Rome divided into seven
warring factions. Aeneas thanks his wife Vestra for a vegetable dish.

### XIV. [De Cognominationibus]() ✤ [On Cognominations]()

Student Donatus asked about *caelum*; Virgilius now responds. Heaven conceals great
mysteries; earth is threefold mother (birth, nourishment, burial "as into a mother's
womb"). Stars are celestial painting; *aster* means "painter." The charioteer Stillinus
drives the stars. Origenes is cited on Joseph's imprisonment. Nature is essential
activity: "human without action, bird without flight, fish without swimming."

### XV. [De Catalogo Grammaticorum]() ✤ [On the Catalog of Grammarians]()

The legendary genealogy: thousand-year-old Donatus of Troy taught Romulus; Virgilius of
Troy wrote seventy volumes; Virgilius Assianus composed the Twelve Latinities; "The third
Virgilius is I MYSELF." Assianus taught young Virgilius notation. The twelve Latinities
include alternative vocabularies and number-systems. Virgilius Assianus wrote verses
identifying thunder's ruler as "the God of the Hebrews." Grandfather Martulis was a
grammarian.

### [Appendix]() ✤ [Appendix: Three Fragments]()

**Angelic Fragment**: Alternative opening with Latinus (not Donatus) as Latin's eponymous
ancestor, living 100 years. Variant readings of the Twelve Latinities.

**Montpellier Fragment**: Teaching excerpts with cross-references to Epitomae and
Epistolae. Grammarian Honoratus criticized; battle terms (*bellum*, *praelium*,
*certamen*, *pugna*) etymologized. "Oratius" quotes Christian vocabulary.

**Milan Fragment**: Heading identifies "Virgilius presbyter Hispanus" (Spanish priest)—the
only statement of origin. Old man Donon prays in illness. Ships are called *rares*; *mare*
means "great thing unknown to mortals." Aeneas says lips (*labia*) "slip into fault daily
through words."
