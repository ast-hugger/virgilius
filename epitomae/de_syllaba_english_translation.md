# III. ON THE SYLLABLE

Syllables are the glue of letters, and it is their essential property that none of them can stand without vowels; hence vowels are called the "queens" of letters. Single syllables ought not to exceed six letters, as in *scrobs*, nor have two vowels—except when a diphthong or some elision is indicated, as in *aes*, *faus*, *laus*, *fraus*. Disyllables, however, when they occur in a noun or verb or any word, will have only two vowels, excepting those cases which we mentioned above.

It should be known that wherever a double *s* follows any vowel placed in the middle of a word, we shall shorten that vowel, as in *uassa*, *fossa*, *clussit*, *uissit*, *uessit*; but if there is a single *s*, the vowel will be lengthened, as in *gloriosus*, *uisus*. Every superlative degree will always have a double *s*, as in *altissimus*. Likewise a double *m* shortens the vowel placed before it, as in *summus*, *gammus*; otherwise it will be lengthened, as in *sumus*, *ramus*. A single letter that does the work of a syllable, just as a strong *i* does, will also be long, as *a*, *e*, *i*, *o*.

Who easily understands the natures of syllables, since they are so often altered that they can be grasped by absolutely no one, because they are flexible according to the arrangement of metrical feet? For indeed, according to the necessity of measuring feet, one syllable is made from two and is called long, as in *audi*, *uade*, *aula*.

Concerning the computation of syllables, since Terrentius has treated this most fully, we shall discuss it briefly, adding only those things which he left out. Every syllable of two or three letters has a numerical value: for you say *al* and indicate eight hundred, and again *bpa* and signify three thousand.

I had intended to extend my discussion of syllables at greater length, but since the order of writing summons us to the treatment of meters, in which feet and syllables are measured, I therefore think it more convenient, with these preliminary remarks about syllables serving as a kind of little preface, to proceed to the exposition of meters.

## TRANSLATOR'S NOTES

### Syllables as "Glue" and Vowels as "Queens"

The opening metaphor—syllables as *glutini literarum* ("glue of letters")—continues the material, almost tactile imagery Virgilius applies to grammatical categories. Law (1995) observes that this physicalized understanding of grammar pervades medieval language theory, where letters, syllables, and words are treated as quasi-material objects that can be joined, separated, and manipulated.

The designation of vowels as *reginae literarum* ("queens of letters") assigns political hierarchy to phonology. This gendering of grammatical elements appears elsewhere in Latin tradition (e.g., the "marriage" of consonants and vowels), but Virgilius's royal metaphor is distinctive. Irvine (1994) notes that such monarchical imagery reflects early medieval assumptions about hierarchical order extending into linguistic structure.

### Conventional Prosody and Invented Forms

This chapter contains Virgilius's most straightforward grammatical teaching. The rules about double consonants shortening preceding vowels reflect genuine Latin prosody and can be found in standard ancient grammars. However, the illustrative forms are characteristically mixed:

- **Standard examples**: *fossa*, *summus*, *altissimus*, *gloriosus*
- **Invented or obscure forms**: *clussit*, *uissit*, *uessit*, *gammus*

The Excerpta Bernensis (preserved in Huemer's apparatus) glosses *uissit* and *uessit* as equivalent to *uidit* ("he saw"), suggesting these may be variant verbal forms from regional Latin rather than pure invention. Law notes that Virgilius often preserves genuine vulgar or regional Latin forms alongside his coinages, making it difficult to distinguish authentic testimony from playful fabrication.

*Gammus* appears nowhere in standard Latin dictionaries. It may be an invented form for illustration, a regionalism, or a word from one of Virgilius's "twelve Latinities."

### Synizesis and Metrical Flexibility

The observation that syllables are "flexible according to the arrangement of metrical feet" (*secundum pedum statum flexibiles*) acknowledges the phenomenon of synizesis—the coalescence of two vowels into one syllable for metrical purposes. Virgilius's examples (*audi*, *uade*, *aula*) are disyllables that can be scanned as monosyllables through vowel contraction.

This prosodic flexibility troubled ancient metricians who sought rigid rules. Virgilius's somewhat exasperated question—"Who easily understands the natures of syllables?"—may reflect genuine pedagogical frustration or may ironically highlight the arbitrariness of metrical conventions. Law suggests Virgilius deliberately foregrounds such difficulties to demonstrate grammar's irreducible complexity.

### Terrentius and the Computation of Syllables

Terrentius, not to be confused with the Roman comic poet Terence (Publius Terentius Afer), is one of Virgilius's most colorful fictional authorities. Elsewhere in the *Epitomae*, Terrentius engages in a legendary debate with Galbungus lasting fourteen days and nights over the vocative of *ego*—a question that has no answer, since *ego* lacks a vocative.

Löfstedt (1984) sees such anecdotes as parody of scholastic disputation: grammarians wasting enormous effort on trivial or insoluble questions. Law alternatively suggests these stories model the intensity of dedication proper to grammatical study—even "impossible" questions deserve exhaustive attention.

The claim that Terrentius treated syllable computation "most fully" (*plenissime*) invests this fictional authority with expertise Virgilius declines to duplicate, a characteristic modesty topos that also excuses brevity.

### Syllable Numerology

The numerical values assigned to syllables (*al* = 800, *bpa* = 3000) continue the cryptic numerological theme from *De Litera*. These values correspond to no known system—neither Roman numerals, Greek isopsephy, Hebrew gematria, nor ogham.

Bischoff (1961) suggested possible Jewish influence on Virgilius's numerology, noting that letter-number equivalences were central to kabbalistic and midrashic traditions. However, Law (1995) argues that Virgilius's numerical systems are deliberately inconsistent, designed to suggest hidden meaning rather than encode actual information. The values may function as tests of student credulity or demonstrations that even meaningless systems can appear significant when clothed in technical authority.

Herren (1979) connects this to the *hisperica famina* tradition, where obscurity itself becomes a pedagogical and aesthetic value.

### The "Little Preface" (*Praefaciuncula*)

Virgilius's self-deprecating diminutive *praefaciuncula* ("little preface") is characteristic of his playful Latin. The double diminutive formation (*praefatio* → *praefatiuncula* → compressed to *praefaciuncula*) creates an almost affectionate minimization—this chapter is not just a preface but a tiny, modest preliminary.

Law notes that such diminutives serve multiple functions: genuine humility, false modesty, and metalinguistic play (the word enacts the smallness it denotes). The acknowledgment that syllables deserve fuller treatment "within the context of meters" promises future elaboration while excusing present brevity—a common rhetorical move in encyclopedic works.

### Transitional Structure

Virgilius's explicit acknowledgment that "the order of writing summons us" (*ordo prouocat scribendi*) to proceed to meters reveals his awareness of the *Epitomae* as a structured curriculum. The progression letter → syllable → meter → word follows the traditional grammatical hierarchy of increasing complexity, from minimal units to composite structures.

This self-conscious attention to pedagogical sequence appears throughout early medieval grammatical writing. Irvine (1994) argues that such structural awareness reflects monastic educational practice, where grammars served as guides for progressive instruction rather than reference works for consultation.
