### VII. ON THE VERB

---

I remember that when I was a young man devoted to scholastic studies, I was present one day at a gathering of grammarians, who, no fewer than thirty assembled together, sought many things in composing the praise and ornament of the arts, and all of them concluded this: that nothing was more useful and suitable for making the composition of testimonies than that a complete exposition of the verb be worthily understood. By whose dispensation and judgment the state of Latinity is both perfected and arises—for all assert that the verb is the principal part of speech. For although it allows the noun to come before it in order, nevertheless in the arrangement of cases it holds the principate; to which the troops of adverbs and conjunctions have given all their right.

The verb, therefore, consists of two elements: *uer* from *uerbere* (the blow), which the tongue inflicts on the throat, and *bum* from *bucino* (the trumpet), which the voice echoes. For just as a human being consists of body and soul, so also the verb consists of tongue and voice. About to set forth in order its seven species, I shall first attempt to discuss that little question which arises among the skilled. For many complain: why in the order of verbs is quality placed first, when the threefold conjugation ought to come before in order, in which the understanding and virtue of the verb is especially displayed? Some, however, have preferred signification to quality, inasmuch as in it the genders of all verbs are understood. To both of these, as to friends not so much contentious as studious, we must give satisfaction according to our strength.

Everyone who possesses a field or province first determines it by lot, so that each one may carefully tend the part declared to him by lot. Thus also the verb must be begun from quality, which is determined by moods and forms as if by certain fixed boundaries. For "mood" signifies nothing other than a certain measure. From these moods, therefore, let us begin to have a treatment.

The first and strongest is called the indicative, which many call the "upright" one of all, but the others "inclined." This one alone of all claims for itself the head of testimony. It is called indicative for this reason: that both what has been done and what is being done and what will be done are indicated through it—as *uido*, *uidaui*, *uidabo*. The imperative is second; through it everything that ought to be done is commanded—as *uida*. Many also take this one at the head, as if Cato judged that this ought to be preferred to the indicative mood—Propertius at least in the plural. But Aeneas and Cicero rebuke this, saying that the indicative mood has been principally used by all certain authorities, but the imperative has always been held secondarily—especially since the imperative mood does not have a first person, which person is defined by humans to be primary, although in the plural number the same person is received in the imperative mood, which some of the ancients also accepted in this number.

The optative mood is so called, through which everything that becomes desirable to the mind is wished for. Whence it also frequently takes on the adverb of wishing, that is *utinam*, whose sense is "I would wish." But a not small question arises: to what extent does this adverb *utinam* suit every person? But this must be said: that the adverb will thus be fitted to every person according to the order of persons—so that *utinam uidarem* is for *uellim*, *utinam uidares* for *uellis*, *utinam uidaret* for *uellit*, and so through the rest. There is also another understanding of this, when *ut* is put in place of *utinam*. By another name Aeneas called it so that he might put "causative" in place of optative; whence also in place of *ut* we very often put *ne* as causal in this place. Another question arises in this same mood: why the optative mood does not supply the usual number of tenses, as the indicative and subjunctive do, but is declined only in a threefold declension with only two tenses joined into one. But this reason must be briefly revealed: that we use this mood thus because more does not suffice for Latinity.

The subjunctive mood is so called for two reasons: either on account of the parts of conjunctions which are joined to it—namely *quamquam*, *quamuis*, *quamlibet*, *nisi*, *sin*—or because in the composition of cases the subjunctive mood is coupled to the preceding indicative, as *cum uidem*. The infinitive mood is called by some the "communicative," for this reason evidently: that it is held common either to noun and verb or to all persons and numbers of verbs. This indeed should be known: that the infinitive mood, whenever it is taken as a noun, fulfills the function of only three cases—namely nominative, accusative, and ablative—which will always happen for the signification of the neuter gender, at least in the singular number.

But that this may be more clearly evident, let us give examples. Cornelius, a man quite eloquent in Latin speech, in a certain letter sent to me thus spoke: *quid nobis potest esse tam suaue quam in hac nostra dilectione manere?* ("What can be so pleasant for us as to remain in this our loving?"). This he put for the ablative. And taking the same mood for a noun in another place, he thus says: *nam sol aestiuo die currere suauissimum est* ("For the sun to run on a summer day is most pleasant"). And lest we use only one example—which has for the most part been forbidden by our elders—we shall bring forth the speech of another skilled man. Hilarius, brother of Lucanus, in a funeral song for Iuvanus thus says: *bellare constans in omni uitae curriculo legisti* ("You have read constant warring in the whole course of life"). This he put for the accusative.

The impersonal mood, however, is thought to be similar to a passive verb. But because it does not receive the person of a noun, therefore it will not be a passive verb. Its rule is said to be this: that if it has come from an active verb, it also acts, yet in such a way that it needs the help of the infinitive mood—according to that saying of Aeneas thus speaking: *Hannibalem legimus die belli dixisse: trium enim centum uirorum potentia armisque utar meme hodie* ("Hannibal is read to have said on the day of battle: 'For the power and arms of three hundred men I shall use myself today'"). But if it has come from a neuter verb, it will necessarily draw the ablative case, as Terrentius says: *curritur a castris* (there is running from the camps)—sometimes also the seventh case, as *uiuitur armis* (one lives by arms). But indeed if it is a passive verb, it attracts a noun, according to that saying of Glengus: *intestinum a Romanis geritur bellum* ("A civil war is being waged by the Romans").

The ancients said many things about the impersonal mood, from which I shall bring forth a few. There are many impersonal verbs which end in *-it*, such as *euenit*, *accidit*, *contingit*. But lest anyone think these are of the third person, let him first know that *accido*, *contingo*, *euenio* cannot be formed, although some think *eueniunt* should be written. *Accido*, *contingo*, *euenio* are full verbs. But these impersonal verbs, which we have said end in the syllable *-it*, take the dative case—as *accidit mihi*, *tibi*, *illi*. There are impersonal verbs which end in *-et*, which however are not of one rule. For some of them come from themselves, such as *oportet*, *pudet*, *taedet*, *paenitet*, *decet*, and the rest—although I have heard some affirm that no impersonal verb is accustomed to be born from itself, but from others, such as *paeniteo*, *taedeo*, *oporteo*, and the rest. There is, however, an impersonal verb which most certainly is born from another, such as *missereor* → *misseret*, which verb does not have a past tense. There are verbs about which reading alone demonstrates whether they are impersonal or personal, for they are known to be of twin signification—such as *placet*, *claret*, *displicet*, *patet*. For there is *placeo*, *places*, *placet*, and so *clareo*, *displiceo*, *pateo*. If therefore these have admitted the nominative case, it is manifest that they are of the third person—as *placet mihi hic sermo* (this speech pleases me). But if they have had the dative case joined to them, which the infinitive mood follows, it appears that they are impersonal—as *placet mihi dicere* (it pleases me to speak). But *claret* and *patet*, when they are impersonal, admit not the dative but the accusative case—as *claret illum* (it is clear about him), yet with the infinitive following. According to these things, *apparet* also is to be understood.

Some have thought that the verb should be extended only this far, so that it should be bounded by six bounded moods. We, however, gladly receive the verbs of gerund or typic added by our elders; about which, if life shall be our companion, we shall treat in their own place.

Now a few things must be said about the forms of verbs, which forms are four. The first of these is the perfect, which is declined perfectly through all moods, numbers, figures, persons, and tenses. The second is the meditative, which sometimes meditates but is not completed. For it is found in one mood and one person, as if the first, and this rarely—such as *facturio*, as if one should say "I intend to speak sometime." The third form is the frequentative, which is so called on account of the frequency of acting—such as *dictito*, that is, "I say often." There are verbs of the frequentative form of the first conjugation which come from verbs of the third conjugation—such as *ago agis*, from which *actito actitas*, and so forth. There are also other verbs of the same form of the first conjugation which are born from verbs of the same conjugation—such as *clamo clamas*, from which *clamito -tas*; so *uoco -cas*, *uocito -tas*; *amo*, *amito*; *impero*, *imperito*. There are furthermore verbs of the same form of the third conjugation, but those from which they are born are of the first conjugation. For we say *uido uidas*, from which *uisso uissis*. Sometimes also under this same form we have known verbs of the first conjugation to be generated from verbs of the second conjugation—such as *uideo uides*, from which *uissito uissitas*. There are also not a few verbs in the same form growing through certain degrees both in letters and in meaning. For we say *curro*, *curso*, *cursito*; but *curro* signifies only this: that placed on a journey I make no delay; *curso*, however, when somewhat more quickly, some necessity pressing, I am forced to hasten; but *cursito* when, with an enemy pursuing me, I flee.

The inchoative form, however, is the fourth, which sometimes pretends to be inchoative, and from this it is manifest that it is not, when it has had a past tense. For whatever verbs have been of the true inchoative form, they will have no past tense in any mood and will be of the third conjugation—such as *floresco*, *lucesco*, *feruesco*, *calesco*, and so forth. These are born, moreover, from verbs of the second conjugation of the perfect form—such as *floreo*, *luceo*, *ferueo*, *caleo*. *Feruere*, however, is understood as from the heat of passion; *calere*, indeed, from the warmth of the body. But verbs which on account of the similarity of letters are thought by the incautious to be similar to inchoatives are these: *erubesco*, *coalesco*, *cognosco*, *agnosco*, *ignosco*. But because these have a past tense, they cannot be inchoative. For we say *erubui*, *coalui*, *ignoui*, *cognoui*, *agnoui*.

With an explanation of the beginnings of the gerund verb made, as if with certain foundations laid, now we must speak about conjugation itself. There are three conjugations: the first from *a*, the second from *e*, the third from *i*. Many diligently discuss why it is called "conjugation." Some indeed hold this in the end: that it is called conjugation because all of Latinity is sustained by these three conjugations as if by a certain yoke. Others, however, think that the conjugations of verbs ought to be ordered on account of the order of letters, in that these letters provide a certain yoke to verbs to be carried by them. Some also believe that conjugations are called from this: that the declension of each one is found in another.

We ought to know this: that a verb of each conjugation has a double future tense. For we say *interrogabo* and *interrogam -ges -get*, *uidebo uideam*, *audibo audiam*, *agam agebo*. There are also other verbs of double conjugation through all things—such as *uido uidas*, *uideo uides*. But *uido* is to be referred to the eyes of the mind; *uideo* to those of the flesh. So *tego tegas* is concealment of counsel, but *tego tegis* signifies a visible covering. So *do das dat* is of spontaneous giving; *dedo dedis* is the coercion of royal force. So Cicero says: *in dedicionem coacti leges accipere Romanorum* ("Forced into surrender to accept the laws of the Romans"). So also *probo probas* is the examination of some matter, but *probo probis* when the hands of physicians handle the bodies of the sick. So also *uolo uolas* is of flying; *uolo uis* is of willing. So also *cogo cogis* is of necessity, but *cogo cogas* is the union of wife to husband. *Usurpo -pas* is of some nomination or presumption, but *usurpeo -pes* is the beginning of writing.

Every conjugation in every active and neuter verb receives *a* or *e* or *i* before the last letter; in every passive, common, and deponent verb, however, it uses the same letters before the last syllable. There are verbs of no conjugation which end in a consonant—such as *sum*, *possum*, the letter. There is *poteo* of the second conjugation and of greater power, but the second person of the prior verb *potes* ought to be shortened; that of the following, however, is to be lengthened: *potes*. There are those who say that certain verbs go in *-i* and therefore are of no conjugation—such as *memini*, *odi*, *noui*. But we refute them by the authority of much reading. For we often find *noro noris norit*, and in the past tense in *-uit*; so also *odio -dis -dit*, *odiui*. *Memini* alone I have not found to end in *-o*.

There are verbs of the third conjugation which, having received lengthening, change meaning—such as *uinco uincis* concerning victory, and it has in the past tense *uici* and *uictus sum* in the passive; but *uincio uincis* concerning binding, and it has in the past *uincxi* and in the passive *uinctus sum*. There are also others of the same conjugation neither completely lengthened nor entirely shortened—such as *suscipio -pis*, *aspicio -cis*. For in the past tense no syllable is added, but the middle letter is changed—as *suscepi*—and the present tense of the imperative mood sends out not in lengthened *-i* but in shortened *-e*—as *suscipe*, *aspice*. So through all things; whence these verbs are also called "deceptive." There are verbs of the first conjugation which end in two vowels in every declension—such as *bassio bassias*, *lanio*, *tripudio*, *radio*, and so forth. There are verbs which are said by many to be of the third long conjugation—such as *eo* and those compounded with it, that is *praetereo*, *praeeo*, *introeo*. But because these verbs now take *e*, now *i*, for which reason by most—especially by the whole school of Galbungus, which I also attended—they are believed to be of the fourth conjugation. When, returning to Aeneas, I reported this among other things, he did not refute it, but said only this: that it has two future tenses, such as *ibo* and *eam*, and so forth.

We define that the numbers of verbs are two without any circumlocution. There are, however, fifty verbs which do not have a singular number—such as *uocitamus*. There are also those which do not receive a plural number at all—*pugillito -tas*—whence also Varro did not dare to say of the Romans that *pugillitauerint*, but avoiding the fault more properly he used to say: *quia pugillitauit unusquisque pro suis uiribus* (because each one boxed for his own strength).

Let us speak about figure. In the treatment of which the usefulness to readers compels me to linger a little longer. For the simple figure is also held more simply. But having received compositions, it changes meaning in the manner of speech and equally reveals it. For *clamo* is of simple clamor; *conclamo* together with many. There is also *acclamo* when I accuse someone falsely—as Cicero concerning Prassius: *innocens solis accusationibus punitus est* ("Innocent, he was punished by accusations alone"). *Reclamo* is calling to someone going out; *inclamo* and *succlamo* are of murmuring; *proclamo* is an exaltation of praising or deprecating; *declamo* is of rhetorizing; *exclamo* when I raise my voice with all my strength. *Salto* is displaying joy with a certain motion of limbs; but in composition the letter is changed—as *exulto*, which is in the voice of expressed joy; *insulto* is of injurious mockery; *persulto* when I make the sound penetrate through the ears even of those standing far off; *resulto* when I respond loudly; *consulto* is the disposition of prudent counsel. *Testor* is confirming something by statement; *contestor* is affirming with a certain authority; *protestor* is announcing things manifestly to be avoided; *obtestor* is calling someone to testimony who is eminent in dignity or authority; *detestor* is spurning something execrable. *Iuro* is testifying a true oath with a certain confirmation of swearing; *periuro* is polluting an oath with falsehood; *adiuro* is beseeching a greater power. *Pono* is simply establishing something; *dispono* is about to do something of more costly work or counsel. *Disponere* is also of entering into a treaty; *propono* sometimes pertains to asking a question; *appono* is of addition; *inpono* is of sewing in; *superpono* is imposing some tax or labor by force on anyone; *praepono* is preferring something, so also *antepono*. For *postpono* is judging something else inferior; *conpono* is of ordering either speech or craft; *sepono* is of separating; *suppono* is leading something underneath; *depono* is of weakening or departing from life. Let it suffice to have said these things about figures as if in passing.

The persons of verbs, as also of pronouns, are three. But there are many verbs which are said to be defective through persons, since indeed we find a verb which lacks the first person—such as *rees reest*, for *resum* or *resumus* Latin speech does not produce. The sense of this verb, however, is this: *reesse* is to remain in a fortification for a long time, as Gratianus says: *Campani in arce per plures annos reeserunt* ("The Campanians remained in the citadel for many years"). There are certain verbs which do not have a second person—such as *soleo solet solemus solent*—although Sebastius introduced the plural second person: *Solebatis*, he says, *o Romani ciues, uestris opitulari pressis* ("You used to help your oppressed, O Roman citizens").

Now, about to speak concerning signification, I ought to be mindful of the precept of my Aeneas, who said that when he set out to write to me, he should not be disfigured by the obscurity of one question left behind. Therefore, mindful of this matter, I ought to discuss the question which comes up. For perhaps someone may ask why I did not immediately after conjugation set forth signification, since this order has been placed by most. But I, relying on Gratianus my teacher, in whose school I spent ten years, have established it thus. For this order is often promoted by him. This I say I have established: that I might come from quality to conjugation, from conjugation to number, from number to figure, from figure to person, from person to signification, and thus to tenses.

Signification is called "genus" by some, which opinion Aeneas most strongly destroys, asserting that genus can belong only to nouns. The significations of verbs, therefore, are five. For some of them are called active, which act—as *Turnum colo* (I cultivate Turnus). Some are neuter, which have neither acting nor suffering in their nature; although some of them seem to act surreptitiously. But truly neuter verbs are in this way—such as *ambulo*, *curro*—although some think that these verbs act through received compositions: *uiam perambulo* (I walk through the road), *scribturam percurro* (I run through the writing). Passive verbs are those which always have suffering. For we say *mittor a Romulo* (I am sent by Romulus). Deponent verbs are those which, although they have the likeness of the passive in declension, nevertheless put down suffering in their very quality—such as *for faris*. Common verbs, however, are called those which have both acting and suffering under the same declension—such as *ueneror regem* (I worship the king) and *ueneror a rege* (I am worshipped by the king). There are also verbs which have a mixed genus; for in part they are declined as active or neuter and in part as deponent—such as *audeo*, *gaudeo*, *soleo*, *fido*; *mereor merui*; *plaudo plausus sum*, and the rest. There are those who thus feel that they are passive and think they come from neutrals—as *gauisus sum*. But we manifestly discover that this is not true. For when we say *ausus sum*, you show that it is not passive but deponent; for I was not dared by someone, but I myself dared either to do or to say what pleased. There are verbs which could come into controversy for many; for they are taught as active by some, as deponent by most—such as *partio*, *populo*, *praedo*, and so forth. Anyone skilled will most easily settle a contention of this kind, because both can be found through the manifold condition of the Latin language.

The tenses of verbs, as also of the age, are three: past, present, future. Hence it moves many: why, when the past tense is the first age, do writers now begin the verb from the present tense? The ancients had the beginning of declining from the perfect past; then, because they did not count the pluperfect and the imperfect past, they proceeded in writing to the present and from the present to the future. But we give the beginning to the verb from the time in which we write, which is most certain. Then, according to the custom of calculators reckoning months and days backward, we take the past from the present tense not passed over, lest it be counted again; we pass to the future.

I shall also explain briefly what that threefold division of past tense seems to itself to mean. The imperfect past is said to be nearest to the present for this reason: that it signifies something done or said not on a certain or appointed day or time, but as if randomly and in some hours. But the perfect past is shown to have been done more certainly and more definitely. Pluperfect is so called for this reason: that it is shown to have been completed more distantly and more perfectly. In a certain manner of those ascending, therefore, we arrive from lower things to higher, that is, from uncertain things to more certain.

The ancients also used to divide the future tense as if into two certain parts—such as *uidebo* and *uidero*—as if what is to come tomorrow and what is to come in a long time were different. Whence also by most they held the promissive mood in use in place of the second future tense. But we, receiving neither a second future tense nor a promissive mood, decline what is near and what is distant under the signification of one future tense. Many also strive to turn the future tense of the optative mood into the imperative mood in the future tense, at least in the first person—such as *audiam*—not putting what signifies the optative mood, that is *ut*, *utinam*, *ne*, *donec*, *usquequo*, *usquedum*, *quoadusque*.

There are verbs which are thought by the unskilled to be defective through tenses, because the sequence of letters does not seem to be shown in them—such as *offero* and in the past tense, with syllables changed, *obtuli*, and likewise in the passive verb in the past tense *oblatus sum*. Lest perhaps you wonder at this, I shall tell you what often happens: that both nouns and pronouns do not preserve the order of letters, although nevertheless they are known to be the same in meaning—such as *bonus melior optimus*, *malus peior pessimus*; so *unus* and *singuli*. In the same way also there will be other verbs of this kind—such as *transfero*, *confero*, and so forth.

There are furthermore verbs which, contrary to customary Latinity, either have syllables added or are diminished. They are added—such as *legero -ris -rit*, *legerimus -ritis -rint*—and this in the indicative mood in the present tense, as the following things declare: imperfect *legerebam*, perfect *legessi*, pluperfect *legesseram*, future *legeram -res -ret*; imperative *legere legerat legeramus legerite* or *legeratis legerant*; future *legerito legerat* and in the plural *legeramus legeritote* or *legeratis legerant* or *legerunto*. Optative mood: *utinam legererem legereres legereret legereremus legereretis legererent*. *Legessissem legessisses legessisset*, *legessissemus -setis -sent*. Future *legeram legeras -rat*—thus duly through this order it is declined, and in the passive it has in the past tense *legestus sum*. But others are diminished—such as *semo semis semit*, and this for *semino*, and the past *sempsi* for *seminaui*, and *semptus sum*.

There are also others which are most difficult in declension—such as *fio fis fit*, although the second person does not please many. Imperfect *fiebam*, perfect *fui*, pluperfect *fueram*, future *fiam fies fiet*; imperative *fiat fiamus*, future *fito fiat*. The optative mood is declined by many as *forem -res -ret*, by some as *fierem*; and it has the passive verb *fior firis fitur* and so forth; *fiebar fitus sum*, future *fiar*; imperative *fiere* and so forth; infinitive *fieri fitum esse* or *fuisse*; participles *fitus fiendus*. But this verb is unknown to many.

There is also another verb quite difficult—such as *sum*, which does not have an imperfect past nor a perfect except pluperfect *eram eras erat*, and in the future *ero eris erit*, and in the imperative mood in the future tense *esto sit simus estote sint*; optative mood *utinam essem esses esset essemus essetis essent*, future *utinam sim sis sit*; subjunctive *cum sim sis sit*, pluperfect *cum essem*, future *cum ero*; infinitive *esse* or *fuisse*. On account of the brevity of this verb, the aforesaid verb *fio* is joined to it as if in a further manner, so that what is lacking in the one may be supplied in the other.

## TRANSLATOR'S NOTES

### The Gathering of Thirty Grammarians

The chapter opens with a striking scene: the young Virgilius attending an assembly of thirty grammarians debating the centrality of the verb. Whether this gathering was historical or literary invention, it establishes the verb's importance within a communal, disputational context.

Law (1995) notes that such scenes of scholarly assembly appear throughout medieval grammatical literature, reflecting either actual pedagogical practices or idealized images of intellectual community. The number thirty may be significant—perhaps echoing biblical or classical conventions—or may simply suggest a substantial gathering.

### Etymology of *Verbum*

The derivation of *verbum* from *uer* (< *uerbere*, "blow") and *bum* (< *bucino*, "trumpet") is characteristic Virgilian invention. The image of speech as tongue striking throat, then voice trumpeting outward, physicalizes grammar in Virgilius's typical manner.

The analogy to body and soul continues the anthropological framework from earlier chapters. Law observes that such corporeal metaphors for language pervade medieval grammatical thinking, treating words as quasi-physical entities.

### The Three Teachers

This chapter uniquely names three teachers:

**Aeneas**: Virgilius's primary master, cited throughout the *Epitomae* on moods, impersonal verbs, and the rejection of "genus" for verbal signification.

**Gratianus**: "In whose school I spent ten years" (*in cuius scola per decem annos degui*). Gratianus determined Virgilius's ordering of verbal categories and is cited on the verb *rees* and the Campanians.

**Galbungus**: Whose "whole school" (*omni scola Galbungi*) Virgilius also attended, where *eo* was taught as fourth conjugation. This is the same Galbungus who elsewhere debates Terrentius for fourteen days.

Law suggests these three teachers may represent different phases of Virgilius's education, different grammatical traditions, or purely literary constructions. The detail about "ten years" with Gratianus lends verisimilitude but proves nothing about historicity.

### The School of Galbungus

The mention of attending Galbungus's school, which taught *eo* as fourth conjugation, is intriguing. When Virgilius reported this to Aeneas, "he did not refute it" (*non refellit*) but merely observed that *eo* has two futures (*ibo* and *eam*).

Löfstedt (1984) sees this as characteristically Virgilian: introducing disagreement among authorities without resolution, leaving students to navigate competing traditions. Law alternatively suggests genuine pedagogical pluralism in early medieval schools.

### *Uido* versus *Uideo*

The distinction between *uido uidas* (mental sight) and *uideo uides* (physical sight) exemplifies Virgilius's technique of generating semantic distinctions through morphological variation. Standard Latin has only *video*; *uido* is a Virgilian form, either invented or drawn from regional/archaic usage.

Similar pairs (*tego tegas* vs. *tego tegis*; *do das* vs. *dedo dedis*; *cogo cogas* vs. *cogo cogis*) create a systematic appearance of double conjugations with differentiated meanings. Whether these reflect actual linguistic variation or pure invention remains debated.

### The Semantic Gradation of *Curro/Curso/Cursito*

The passage distinguishing *curro* (traveling without delay), *curso* (hastening under necessity), and *cursito* (fleeing from a pursuing enemy) shows Virgilius's interest in aspectual and intensive distinctions. The gradation suggests increasing urgency and desperation.

Law notes that frequentative verbs (*cursito*, *dictito*, *actito*) were a genuine feature of Latin, though Virgilius's semantic specifications go beyond standard grammatical description. Such fine-grained distinctions may reflect pedagogical elaboration or literary invention.

### Signification versus Genus

Aeneas "most strongly destroys" (*fortissime destruit*) the opinion that verbal signification should be called "genus," which belongs only to nouns. This terminological dispute reflects real ancient disagreement about whether "voice" (active, passive, etc.) and "gender" (masculine, feminine, neuter) share a category.

The insistence on distinct terminology for nouns and verbs shows awareness of categorical distinctions that later grammarians would elaborate. Law connects this to broader early medieval concerns about the systematic organization of grammatical knowledge.

### The Invented Verb *Rees*

The verb *rees reest* ("to remain in a fortification"), lacking first person (*resum* is "not Latin"), exemplifies Virgilius's catalog of defective verbs. The citation from Gratianus about Campanians remaining in a citadel provides narrative context for an otherwise unattested form.

Löfstedt treats *rees* as pure invention; Law suggests it may preserve a dialectal or archaic form. The semantic specificity ("remaining in a fortification for a long time") is characteristic of Virgilius's tendency to assign precise meanings to obscure or invented vocabulary.

### The Extended Verb *Legero*

The complete paradigm for *legero* (an extended form of *lego*) is one of Virgilius's most elaborate inventions. The declension through all moods and tenses—*legero*, *legerebam*, *legessi*, *legesseram*, etc.—demonstrates how Latin "could" work if systematically extended.

Law interprets such paradigms as grammatical thought experiments: explorations of morphological possibility rather than descriptions of actual usage. They may also serve pedagogical purposes, helping students internalize patterns by seeing them applied to unfamiliar forms.

### *Fio* and *Sum*

The extended treatment of *fio* and *sum*—difficult, irregular verbs—shows Virgilius engaging with genuine grammatical complexity. His observation that *fio* is "unknown to many" (*multis incognitum*) and joined to *sum* "so that what is lacking in the one may be supplied in the other" reflects actual Latin usage where *fio* serves as passive to *facio* and interacts with *sum*.

The passive *fior firis fitur* is Virgilian elaboration—standard Latin *fio* has no distinct passive—but the impulse to regularize reflects grammatical logic rather than mere invention.

### The Promissive Mood

The reference to a "promissive mood" (*promissiuum modum*) used by ancients for a second future tense is intriguing. No such mood appears in standard Latin grammar, but the idea of a distinct future for promises or intentions has conceptual coherence.

Law suggests this may reflect actual distinctions in spoken late Latin or may be Virgilian elaboration of aspectual categories. The rejection of this mood ("we, receiving neither a second future nor a promissive mood") positions Virgilius as both conservative and systematic.

### Verbal Compounds

The extensive treatment of compound verbs (*clamo* → *conclamo*, *acclamo*, *reclamo*, etc.) provides genuine semantic analysis. The distinctions—*conclamo* (cry together), *reclamo* (call to departing person), *proclamo* (praise loudly), *declamo* (rhetorize)—correspond to actual Latin usage.

This section demonstrates that beneath Virgilius's eccentricities lies real grammatical knowledge. The compounds of *pono*, *testor*, and *iuro* similarly reflect accurate understanding of how Latin prefixes modify meaning.

### Varro's Avoidance

The anecdote about Varro avoiding *pugillitauerint* (a frequentative perfect plural) and instead saying "each one boxed" (*pugillitauit unusquisque*) is charming. Whether or not historical, it illustrates grammatical sensibility about rare or awkward forms.

The attribution to "Varro" may refer to the historical polymath M. Terentius Varro, but given Virgilius's tendency to invent authorities, certainty is impossible.
