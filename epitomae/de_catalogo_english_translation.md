# XV. ON THE CATALOG OF GRAMMARIANS

The first, therefore, was a certain old man Donatus at Troy, whom they report to have lived a thousand years. When he had come to Romulus, by whom the city of Rome was founded, he was received most gratefully by him and spent four continuous years there, building a school and leaving behind innumerable little works, in which he would propose riddles, saying: "What is that woman, O son, who extends her breasts to innumerable sons, which the more they have been sucked, the more they overflow in her?" This is Wisdom.

What is the difference between *uerbum* and *sermo* and *sententia* and *loquela* and *oratio*? *Uerbum* is everything that is uttered by tongue and voice. *Sermo*, however, is that whose name is composed from two words, that is, *serendo* (sowing) and *monendo* (admonishing). *Sententia*, indeed, is that which is conceived by the sense. Furthermore, *loquela* is when the order of speech is woven with a certain eloquence. *Oratio* is when the speech, having first been spoken, reaches all the way to the art of the hands to be written down.

There was likewise at Troy a certain Virgilius, a student of this same Donatus, who was most diligent in writing verses, who wrote seventy volumes on the theory of meter and a letter sent to Virgilius Assianus on the explanation of the verb. The third Virgilius is **I MYSELF**.

For Virgilius Assianus was a student of the aforesaid one, a man exceedingly serviceable to holy men, so that the speech of one calling would never find him in his seat. This man I saw with my own eyes, and when I was a little boy he scratched out notes for me. He wrote a noble book on the twelve Latinities, which he called by these names:

**I. USITATA** (ordinary), which is held in the use of Roman eloquence and by which Latin writings are inked—that is, written.

**II. ASSENA**, that is, notarial, which is content with only one letter for a whole sound, and this is depicted in certain formulas.

**III. SEMEDIA**, that is, neither wholly unusual nor wholly usual, as is *mota gelus*, that is, "high mountain," and *gilmola* for *gula* (throat).

**IV. NUMEROSA**, which has its own numbers, such as *nim* for one, *dun* for two, *tor* for three, *quir* for four, *quan* for five, *ses* for six, *sem* for seven, *onx* for eight, *amin* for nine, *ple* for ten—which is said from plenitude. And thus *nimple* for eleven, all the way to *plasin* for twenty, and *torlasin* for thirty, and *quirlasin* for forty, all the way to *bectan* for one hundred, and it reaches all the way to *colephin* for one thousand, and the rest.

**V. METROFIA**, that is, intellectual, such as *dicantabat*, that is, "beginning"; *sade*, that is, "justice"; *gno*, "utility"; *bora*, that is, "fortitude"; *ter*, that is, "conjugal duality"; *rfoph*, that is, "veneration"; *brops*, that is, "piety"; *rihph*, that is, "hilarity"; *gal*, that is, "kingdom"; *fhal*, that is, "religion"; *clitps*, that is, "nobility"; *mymos*, "dignity"; *fann*, that is, "recognition"; *idio*, that is, "honor"; *gabpal*, that is, "obedience"; *blaqth*, that is, "light of the sun"; *merc*, that is, "rain"; *pal*, "day and night"; *gatrb*, that is, "peace"; *biun*, that is, "water and fire"; *spax*, "longevity." By these things the whole world is governed and made prosperous.

**VI. LUMBROSA**, that is, very long, when a whole verse is written for one ordinary word. Examples of this are these, such as: *gabitariu cum bresin galsiste ion*—that is, *legere* (to read). Likewise: *nebesium almigero pater panniba*—that is, *uita* (life).

**VII. SINCOLLA**, that is, very short—conversely, when a whole ordinary verse is contained in one word. Examples of this are these, such as *gears*—that is, *mores colligite, bona diligite* (gather morals, cherish good things). Likewise *biro*—that is, *linquere parentes utile non est* (it is not useful to abandon parents).

**VIII. BELSAUIA**, that is, perverted, when it transmutes the cases of nouns and mood of verbs. Examples of this are these, such as *lex* means *legibus* (by laws) and *legibus* means *lex* (law), and *rogo* means *rogate* (ask ye) and *rogant* means *rogo* (I ask).

**IX. PRESINA**, that is, spacious, when one word signifies many ordinary things, such as *sur*—that is, either "field" or "eunuch" or "sword" or "river."

**X. MILITANA**, that is, multiform, when many words are put for one ordinary word, such as for *cursus* (running): *gammon*, *sualin*, *selon*, *rabath*.

**XI. SPELA**, that is, most lowly, which always speaks of earthly things, such as *sabon*—that is, *lepus* (hare); *gabul*—that is, *uulpis* (fox); *gariga*—that is, *grus* (crane); *lena*—that is, *gallina* (hen). Ursinus used this one.

**XII. POLEMA**, that is, supernal, which treats of higher things, such as *alippha* for *anima* (soul); *spiridon* for *spiritus* (spirit); *repota* for certain supernal virtues; *sanamiana anus* for a certain unity of the high God. This man always spoke in this kind.

Virgilius Assianus, a certain firstborn at Cappadocia, was a most sweet man, quite learned in natural philosophy and most sagacious in the computation of the moon and months. To his students asking about thunder, he used to say that it was a certain spirit of an unusual wind, which thunders upon the world at appointed times and whose sound thunders forth, whose nature is this: that it alone thrusts itself upon human uses, which has not so much breath as a fiery flame, which he asserted to be both higher than all winds and to penetrate the depths of all things.

When I asked him whether this wind was ruled by its own command or another's, taking up a little page he composed four poetic verses, speaking thus:

> *summa in summis,*<br>
> *potens caelis,*<br>
> *celsaque cuncta*<br>
> *gubernat celsa.*

> In the highest heights,<br>
> powerful in the heavens,<br>
> and all lofty things<br>
> the Lofty One governs.

That is, the God of the Hebrews.

Istrius, a Spanish man, of quite splendid eloquence in the composition of histories, gave me a certain comparison, saying: "The verb plays the role of the sun in testimonies; for just as a day without the sun is not bright, so a testimony without the verb is not luminous." He says: "O king, know that just as your handmaid has been allotted this common life with you, so also you will undergo common death with me." Likewise an interrogation: "O greedy one, why do heaven, earth, and sea bring their gifts to you, and you do not bring your goods to your neighbor?" Likewise: "As a fish in the sea devouring whatever it meets and unable to be satisfied, so the mind of a greedy man knows not how to be satisfied in a whole age." Thus far Istrius.

There was in Egypt Gregorius, greatly devoted to Greek studies, who wrote three thousand books on the histories of the Greeks. There was at Nicomedia Balapsidus, recently deceased, who translated the books of our law—which I hear in the Greek language—into Latin at my command, whose beginning is: *in principio celum terramque mare omniaque astra spiritus intus fouet* ("In the beginning the spirit within cherishes heaven and earth and sea and all the stars").

There were furthermore three Lucani, one in Arabia, another in India, a third in Africa, whom my Aeneas had as teachers, whose books he transferred into clear writing by means of the notarial art. In these he discovered that a certain man Maro had existed near the time of the Flood, whose wisdom no ages will be able to narrate. Whence Aeneas, when he had seen me to be talented, commanded me to be named by this name, saying: "This my son shall be called Maro, because in him the spirit of the ancient Maro has revived."

There was also my grandfather Martulis, a man quite learned and bright of countenance. He was most diligent in the grammatical art.

Let it suffice to have suggested these things to you, O companions and students, excerpted from the books of paternal laws, for the utility and salvation of all who read.

## TRANSLATOR'S NOTES

### The Legendary Donatus of Troy

The chapter opens with *senex Donatus apud Troiam* (old man Donatus at Troy), who lived a thousand years, came to Romulus when Rome was founded, spent four years teaching, and left innumerable works containing riddles. This Donatus is clearly legendary, not the historical fourth-century grammarian Aelius Donatus who wrote the famous *Ars Grammatica*.

The connection to Troy evokes both Virgilian epic (Aeneas fleeing Troy to found Rome) and the tradition of Trojan founders. Law (1995) notes that by placing the origin of grammatical teaching in mythical antiquity, Virgilius claims for his discipline a lineage older than Rome itself.

### The Riddle of Wisdom

Donatus's riddle—"What woman extends her breasts to innumerable sons, which the more they are sucked, the more they overflow?"—answered as *sapientia* (Wisdom), recalls Proverbs and patristic imagery of Lady Wisdom as nursing mother (cf. Proverbs 9:1-6, Sirach 24). The inexhaustible breasts suggest that wisdom increases through sharing, unlike material goods.

Smyth (1996) connects such personification to Irish wisdom literature, where *Sapientia* appears frequently as maternal figure. The image sets a sapiential rather than merely technical tone for the catalog.

### The Fivefold Distinction of Speech

The distinction between *uerbum*, *sermo*, *sententia*, *loquela*, and *oratio* reflects ancient rhetorical categories:

- **Uerbum**: Basic utterance by tongue and voice
- **Sermo**: From *serere* (sow) + *monere* (admonish)—speech that plants and warns
- **Sententia**: What the sense conceives internally
- **Loquela**: Speech woven with eloquence
- **Oratio**: Speech reaching written form ("the art of the hands")

The progression from voice to writing suggests a hierarchy culminating in permanent inscription. This privileges the written over the spoken, characteristic of a literate grammatical culture.

### The Three Virgils

Virgilius presents an apostolic succession of three grammarians named Virgilius:

1. **Virgilius of Troy**: Student of Donatus; wrote seventy volumes on meter
2. **Virgilius Assianus**: Student of the Trojan Virgilius; author of the Twelve Latinities
3. **Virgilius EGO**: "I myself"—our author

The dramatic self-identification *Tertius Virgilius EGO* ("The third Virgilius is I MYSELF") is one of the most direct autobiographical statements in the work. The emphatic **EGO** marks Virgilius's claim to stand in ancient succession. The name "Virgilius" becomes a title of grammatical authority rather than merely a personal name.

Significantly, this lineage makes no reference to the classical poet Virgil (Publius Vergilius Maro), author of the *Aeneid*. Virgilius Maro Grammaticus claims a different Maro entirely—an antediluvian sage.

### Personal Memory of Virgilius Assianus

Virgilius claims to have seen Assianus "with my own eyes" (*meis oculis*) and to have received childhood instruction from him: "when I was a little boy he scratched out notes for me" (*puerulo mihi notas caraxauit*). This is the closest the *Epitomae* comes to verifiable autobiography.

The description of Assianus as "exceedingly serviceable to holy men" (*admodum ministratorius sanctis uiris*), never sitting when called, suggests monastic or clerical devotion. Herren (1979) considers this personal testimony the strongest evidence for Virgilius's actual existence, though the historical accuracy of the details remains uncertain.

### The Twelve Latinities

This remarkable system of twelve types of Latin—attributed to Virgilius Assianus—constitutes the chapter's centerpiece. The names suggest a hierarchy from ordinary to esoteric:

**I. Usitata** (Ordinary): Standard Latin, "by which writings are inked"

**II. Assena** (Notarial): Single letters for whole sounds—shorthand

**III. Semedia** (Half-and-half): Mixed usual/unusual vocabulary

**IV. Numerosa** (Numeral): A complete alternative number system

**V. Metrofia** (Intellectual): Abstract/spiritual vocabulary, by which "the whole world is governed"

**VI. Lumbrosa** (Very long): Whole verses for single words

**VII. Sincolla** (Very short): Single words for whole verses

**VIII. Belsauia** (Perverted): Grammatical inversion of cases and moods

**IX. Presina** (Spacious): One word with multiple meanings

**X. Militana** (Multiform): Multiple words for one meaning

**XI. Spela** (Lowly): Earthly/animal vocabulary

**XII. Polema** (Supernal): Spiritual/theological vocabulary

### Interpreting the Twelve Latinities

Scholars have proposed several interpretations:

**Hisperic Tradition**: Herren (1974) connects these to the *hisperica famina*, obscure Hiberno-Latin texts using strange vocabulary. The twelve Latinities may codify practices found in Irish and British learned circles. Several terms resemble *hisperica famina* vocabulary.

**Cryptographic System**: The system could serve as code for concealing meaning from the uninitiated, consistent with Aeneas's rationale for *scinderatio* in Chapter XIII ("lest pigs trample gems").

**Parody**: Löfstedt (1984) suggests Virgilius parodies grammatical pretension by inventing absurd technical systems—a learned joke about linguistic obscurantism.

**Pedagogical Exercise**: The Latinities may represent teaching tools for exploring linguistic creativity and the arbitrary nature of signs.

**Genuine Tradition**: Law argues that some elements may reflect genuine, if obscure, late antique or early medieval learned traditions.

### Hebrew Echoes in the Metrofia

Some Metrofia vocabulary resembles Hebrew or Semitic words: *sade* (justice) echoes צדק (*tsedeq*, righteousness); *gal* (kingdom) may reflect גל or other roots; *amin* recalls אמן (*amen*). Bischoff (1961) cited such parallels as evidence for Jewish influence on Virgilius's learning.

However, Law cautions that apparent Hebraisms may be coincidental, filtered through patristic sources, or deliberately crafted to suggest oriental learning without genuine Semitic knowledge.

### *Spela* and *Polema*: Low and High

The contrast between Spela (XI, "lowly," treating earthly animals) and Polema (XII, "supernal," treating spiritual realities) creates a vertical hierarchy of language corresponding to ontological levels. The practitioner of Spela named "Ursinus" (bear-like?) handles hares and foxes; the unnamed practitioner of Polema "always spoke in this kind" about the soul and "a certain unity of the high God."

This suggests that different Latinities suit different subjects—mundane matters require mundane vocabulary, while theology demands its own sacred language.

### The Poem on Divine Governance

The four-line poem Virgilius Assianus composed on thunder's governance is significant:

> *summa in summis, potens caelis, celsaque cuncta gubernat celsa*

The gloss "that is, the God of the Hebrews" (*id est Hebreorum deum*) explicitly identifies this cosmic governor with the biblical God. This is one of the clearest Christian/Jewish theological statements in Virgilius's work.

Stevenson (1987-88) connects such poetry to the hymn *Altus Prosator*, attributed to Columba, which shares similar cosmic and theological themes. The poem's style—short cola, emphatic repetition (*summa/summis*, *celsa/celsaque*)—resembles early Irish Latin hymnody.

### Istrius the Spanish Historian

Istrius (*uir Hispanus*, "a Spanish man") is praised for eloquence in historical composition. His contributions include:

1. **The verb-sun comparison**: "The verb plays the role of the sun in testimonies"—connecting grammar to cosmology
2. **Address to a king on mortality**: An audacious reminder of royal mortality, perhaps echoing prophetic speech
3. **Rebuke of the greedy**: Moral rhetoric demanding generosity
4. **The greedy fish comparison**: Satire on insatiable desire

The Spanish origin may be significant—Isidore of Seville (d. 636) was roughly contemporary with Virgilius, and Visigothic Spain produced major Latin scholarship. Whether Istrius is historical or invented, he represents grammatical learning combined with prophetic-ethical speech.

### Balapsidus and the Latin Bible

Balapsidus of Nicomedia, "recently deceased" (*nuper uita functus*), translated "the books of our law" (*nostrae legis libros*) from Greek to Latin at Virgilius's command. The opening—"In the beginning the spirit within cherishes heaven and earth and sea and all the stars"—combines Genesis 1:1-2 with Virgilian hexameter style (cf. *Aeneid* 6.726: *spiritus intus alit*).

This remarkable claim suggests Virgilius commissioned a Bible translation. The phrase "which I hear in the Greek language" (*quos ego in greco audio sermone*) implies he knew Greek scripture aurally (through liturgy?) but wanted a Latin version. The historicity of this claim is uncertain, but it positions Virgilius as patron of scriptural scholarship.

### The Three Lucani and the Antediluvian Maro

Aeneas's three teachers, located in Arabia, India, and Africa, form a geographic triangle encompassing the known world. The name "Lucani" (perhaps from *lux*, light) suggests illumination.

In their books, Aeneas discovered "a certain man Maro near the time of the Flood, whose wisdom no ages will be able to narrate." This primordial Maro—existing before the biblical Flood—becomes the prototype for Virgilius's name.

Aeneas's declaration—"This my son shall be called Maro, because in him the spirit of the ancient Maro has revived" (*quia in eo antiqui Maronis spiritus rediuiuit*)—uses language suggesting metempsychosis or prophetic succession. Virgilius is spiritual heir of antediluvian wisdom.

This connects Virgilius Maro Grammaticus not to the classical poet Virgil but to a pre-Flood sage, placing grammatical wisdom in primordial rather than classical time. Law interprets this as a deliberate "wisdom tradition" bypassing Rome entirely.

### Grandfather Martulis

The brief notice of Virgilius's grandfather—"Martulis, a man quite learned and bright of countenance, most diligent in the grammatical art" (*uir satis doctus et uultu limpidus, in arte grammatica studiosissimus*)—is the only reference to biological family. The name Martulis is otherwise unknown.

That grandfather and grandson shared grammatical vocation suggests a family tradition of learning, lending verisimilitude to the autobiographical frame. Whether Martulis was historical or invented to ground the cosmic lineage in domestic reality remains uncertain.

### The Conclusion and Its Implications

The final words address "companions and students" (*sodales atque discentes*), confirming the pedagogical setting. The phrase "books of paternal laws" (*legum paternarum libris*) is ambiguous—perhaps ancestral grammatical traditions, biblical/legal texts, or the works of the grammarian "fathers" just cataloged.

The closing purpose "for the utility and salvation" (*pro utilitate atque salute*) of readers gives the *Epitomae* quasi-spiritual purpose: grammar serves not merely practical ends but the reader's *salus*—welfare, health, or salvation. This elevates grammatical study to a salvific discipline.

### Historical Assessment

What can we believe? Scholars remain divided:

**Clearly legendary**: Donatus of Troy (thousand years old, met Romulus), the antediluvian Maro

**Possibly historical**: Virgilius Assianus (personal memory claimed), Martulis (grandfather), elements of the Twelve Latinities

**Uncertain**: Istrius, Gregorius, Balapsidus, the three Lucani

Law (1995) concludes that Virgilius creates a "wisdom tradition" connecting his grammatical teaching to primordial revelation. Whether this reflects actual belief, literary play, or pedagogical strategy—and how much historical kernel underlies the legendary elaboration—remains the central question of Virgilian scholarship.
