### VI. ON THE PRONOUN

*[Translator's note: Virgilius treats the pronoun as "subservient" to the noun, continuing the hierarchy established in the previous chapter. The chapter is notable for its extensive catalog of defective and invented pronouns, its distinction between pronouns and articles, and its concluding teachings from Aeneas on word order.]*

---

We have rendered as we could in the preceding epitome an account to those requiring it, explaining why we preferred the noun to the verb. Now another kind of question looms: why also the pronoun should precede the verb, when the verb is the distinguished one of all the parts. To these the answer must be given in this way: that in the division of all the parts of speech, some have said there are eight parts, while others, diminishing the same number, have thought that the noun and pronoun should be reduced into the same part. Also lumping together the verb and participle into one, they said it was absurd to separate the participle from the verb just as a limb from a body. They also thought that adverbs and conjunctions were one part, setting aside the preposition and interjection, and thus it was that instead of eight parts they counted five. By this reasoning, therefore, they were unwilling to separate the pronoun from the noun, just as associates from a king.

The pronoun, however, is a subservient part of speech, which indeed seems to be weak without the support of the noun. But the noun very greatly needs its aid, especially since it completes and retains its function only when that noun has been brought forth before—as Flaccus writes: *uidimus de Hebreis elegantem uirum et mirati sumus eum amplexique eum* ("We saw an elegant man from among the Hebrews, and we admired him and embraced him"), for he did not say "man" again after "admired." Nevertheless, even when the person of the pronoun is gathered together with the noun itself, it is not rejected—as if you should say *Tullius ipse aduersus te scribsit* ("Tullius himself wrote against you").

Between the pronoun and the noun, however, this is the difference: that the pronoun, lacking comparison, has person—such as *ego*, *tu*, *ille*—but the noun, person being cast aside, receives comparison—such as *carus*, *carior*, *carissimus*. There are pronouns of every gender and of one person, such as *ego* and *tu*; and there are conversely those of one gender and every person, such as *ipse* and *qui*. For you say: *ego ipse qui dico* (I myself who say), *tu ipse qui dicis* (you yourself who say), *ille ipse qui dicit* (he himself who says), *nos ipsi qui dicimus* (we ourselves who say), *uos ipsi qui dicitis* (you yourselves who say), *illi ipsi qui dicunt* (they themselves who say).

The known pronouns, because they are held in use, it is not necessary for us to decline, but we must discuss their compositions in some part. Many pronouns indeed are compounded, such as *egomet*, *tumet*, *hicce*, *haecce*, *hocce*, *quisquis*, *quisnam*, *quislibet*, *quiscumque*, *quisque*, *quispiam*. Many wish *idem* to be *isdem*, just as *eadem* and *idem*. But since *idem* when lengthened is of masculine gender and when shortened is of neuter, and *d* can only be between two vowels, therefore *s* and a second *d* are not received in these pronouns. This also which others write as *eumdem* and *quemdam* is not authentic, because by the incautious they were thought to be two words; but it should be written thus: *eundem*, *eandem*, *eorundem*; *quendam*, *quandam*, *quorundam*.

That adverbs are born from pronouns is most certain—such as *quondam* from *quodam*, *ollim* from *olli*, *cuiatim* from *cuio*, *meatim* from *meo*. Homer in a certain verse wrote: *ipseue ab ipso*. *Qui* in the ablative case is of every gender: *a qui uiro* (from which man), *a qui muliere* (from which woman), *a qui uerbo* (from which word), and so *a quis omnibus* (from which all).

There are unknown pronouns, which are defective in many ways. Some indeed are declined only in the nominative, such as *uspis*—whence *uspiam*. Some have nominative and genitive, such as *illus illius*, *illas illae*, *illum illi*; so *ipsus*, *ipsas*, *ipsum*. There are those which are declined in three cases: *cuius cuii cuio*, *cuia cuiae cuiae*, *cuium cuii cuio*. There are those which are declined in four cases, such as *helus helius heli helum*, *hela helius heli helam*, *helum helius heli helum*. There are also those which use five cases, such as *eccum*: dative *ecco*, accusative *eccum*, vocative *eccum*, ablative *ecco*. This is masculine; the feminine is *ecca*: dative *eccae*, accusative *eccam*, vocative *ecca*, ablative *ecca*. The neuter is *ellum*: dative *elli*, accusative *ellum*, vocative *ellum*, ablative *ello*. But they lack the plural number. *Alius* does not have a genitive.

There are pronouns which, except for the nominative of both numbers, do not have the remaining cases—such as *nostras nostrates*, *cuias cuiates*. These are of two genders, for the neuter has *nostra nostrata*. The compositions of certain pronouns are either prefixed or suffixed—such as *quisdam* and *egomet*. *Se* cannot have a nominative of either number. *Totus* does not have a plural genitive, and this is a pronoun; but *omnis* is an adjective noun. *Ullus*, having received *n*, has the force of negating; and with *non* added, as *nonnulli*, it signifies "many," and this happens only in the plural number. *Quotus* is declined like *totus*; but *quot* is an adverb of number. *Unus* is compounded through certain degrees, such as *unusquis*, and is added to make *unusquisque*, and has in the plural *singuli quique*.

From this point, all pronouns of number do not have a singular number, such as *duo* and *tres*. By the ancients they are declined: *dui duorum duis duos a duis*, and so *ambi*. But more correctly they are declined: *duo duum duobus duos a duobus*, and so *ambo ambuum ambobus*. *Alter alterius* is said of two; but *alternus* is said of the alternations of successions, as Cicero says: *uigilias inquit alternas seruabant sibi succedentes* ("They kept watches," he says, "alternating, succeeding one another").

*Qui* and *quis*, *quae* and *qua*, *quod* and *quid* are found similarly, but they have one declension and ought not to be joined to the nominative, but to the genitive plural or ablative of the same number—such as *aliquis hominum* (someone of men) or *aliquis ex hominibus* (someone from among men), but not *aliquis homo*—although we do find this in one way only. *Qui* is attached to the nominative when it is taken for *ille*.

It is indeed asked what the difference is between a pronoun and an article. An article is that which is declined not in place of a noun but with the noun itself—such as *hic pater* (this father)—for we have shown that an article is less than an art. For other pronouns are said to stand alone, though with a noun preceding; but this one does not stand without the help of a first noun.

Between *is* and *hic* this is the difference: that *is* is subjoined—as *at is* (but he). But nevertheless, if it has a subjunctive conjunction coupled to it, *is* can be placed first—as *is autem* (he however), *is uero* (he indeed). But *hic* is always placed first—as *hic enim* (for this one). If ever it has been coupled to a conjunction of prepositive order, then it is lawfully subjoined—as *quoniam hic* (since this one).

We read that *mei* or *mis* is declined. Why is this added? This is to be understood thus: that *mis* is not said except of that thing which, having been promised to me by someone, I hope will come about; but *mei* is said of that which I possess at present.

There are also other pronouns which are not held in customary use in Latinity and yet are undoubtedly received—in the masculine gender, such as *mus*: genitive *mi*, dative *mo*, accusative *mum*, vocative *mi*, ablative *mo*; and in the plural *mi morum mis mos o mi a mis*. In the feminine: *ma mae mae mam o ma a ma*; in the plural *mae marum mis mas mae a mis*. The neuter is *mum*—in place of which *meus* is held in use; so also *tus* will be for *tuus*.

There is another neuter pronoun which, except for the nominative alone, has no declension—such as *mos*, that is, *aliut*. There are those who join persons, to whom one should by no means yield—such as *ego ille*, *tu ille*. For except for those pronouns which suit every person, every such conjunction is to be execrated. *Solus* ought to be declined through all cases except the plural genitive.

Pronouns of quantity and quality will have their declension not according to the rule of pronouns to be declined, but according to the likeness of adjectives—such as *qualis talis*, *quantus tantus*. But this happens for this reason: that they come from primary nouns—such as *qualitas talitas*, *quantitas tantitas*. There are also others which have been introduced by some, though with incongruous reasoning—such as *quantotus tantotus*, genitive *quantotius tantotius*, and the rest—which the poet Fabianus was accustomed to use frequently, just as in a certain verse he elegantly put:

> *quantotae tuae tonant carminibus Iuliane uxores aptae.*
> (How great your wives resound with songs, O Julian, fitted!)

There are those who think that diminutive or derivative pronouns can be found, with whose opinions I neither disagree nor openly assent. Diminutives are such as *solulus*, *ullulus*, *unulus*, *totulus*. Derivatives are such as *mealis*, *tualis*, *sualis*, *nostralis*, *uestralis*, *alteralis*. Pronouns were placed by some in place of verbs in cases, which could be judged as a kind of error, since even primary nouns cannot be put before verbs. I read in a certain booklet of the Sibyl of Carginea: *templis inque parietibus dium innumeris ille* ("In temples and on walls of the gods, innumerable, *ille*").

Blessed Aeneas thought that a noun ought to be placed before a verb in one place only: when the same verb preceded a noun of the first position and another followed, giving a brief ending to the case. Examples of this matter are ready at hand, as the same one says:

> *sol in caelo splendet radius*
> (the sun in heaven shines, a ray)

and again:

> *uir in eo uiget cor*
> (the man in him thrives, the heart)

and elsewhere:

> *deus fortis est potentiae ius*
> (God is strong, the law of power)

This Aeneas defined *ego* to be the first of all pronouns, because it is both of every gender and of the first person. He also used to say that *ille* ought to refer not to just any person, but to a superior person—as Homer says:

> *ille opulentissimus rex regina usus dea illa coniuge cara*
> (that most wealthy king, having used a queen, a goddess, that dear spouse)

and again:

> *ille lunam potens plenam spiritus ingnit in placorem lucis*
> (that one, powerful, kindles the full moon of spirit into the calm of light)

But let these things about Aeneas suffice, and at the same time let an end be given here to the treatment of the pronoun, as we hasten to undertake the explanation of the verb.

## TRANSLATOR'S NOTES

### The Five-Part Theory of Speech

Virgilius opens by discussing grammarians who reduced the standard eight parts of speech to five by merging related categories. This reductionist theory is attested in ancient grammar—Varro mentions disputes about the number of parts—but Virgilius's specific formulation (noun+pronoun, verb+participle, adverb+conjunction, plus preposition and interjection) does not correspond exactly to any known source.

Law (1995) notes that debates about the number of parts of speech continued throughout late antiquity and the early Middle Ages. The image of the pronoun as "associates" (*socios*) refusing separation from a king reflects the hierarchical social metaphors Virgilius frequently applies to grammar.

### Defective Pronouns and Invented Paradigms

The extensive catalog of pronouns classified by how many cases they possess (one through five) is Virgilius's most systematic treatment of defectiveness. While some forms are attested—*eccum* and *ellum* appear in Plautus—most of the paradigms are inventive elaborations.

The pronoun *helus/hela/helum* (declined in four cases) is otherwise unattested and appears to be invented. Löfstedt (1984) sees such paradigms as playful exploration of logical possibilities: if pronouns can be defective, what would maximally defective paradigms look like? Law alternatively suggests these may preserve archaic or dialectal forms, though no corroborating evidence exists.

### The Primitive Pronoun *Mus*

The paradigm for *mus/ma/mum* as a primitive form underlying *meus* is pure grammatical fiction. Virgilius presents it as a pronoun "not held in customary use" (*usitata latinitate non habetur*) yet "undoubtedly received" (*indubitanter recipiuntur*)—a characteristic hedge that claims authority for invented forms.

Law notes that positing primitive forms to explain existing vocabulary was a recognized etymological technique in ancient grammar. Virgilius extends this method to generate entire paradigms for hypothetical proto-pronouns. The parallel *tus* for *tuus* completes the pattern.

### The *Mei*/*Mis* Distinction

The semantic distinction between *mei* (present possession) and *mis* (future hope) is invented. Standard Latin has only *mei* as the genitive of *ego*. However, the distinction reflects genuine philosophical interest in temporal modes of possession—what one has versus what one expects.

Herren (1979) connects such inventions to Irish grammatical traditions, where distinctions between aspectual and temporal categories were elaborated beyond classical norms.

### Pronouns versus Articles

Virgilius's distinction between pronouns (standing *in place of* a noun) and articles (declining *with* a noun) addresses a genuine grammatical problem. Latin has no definite article like Greek ὁ/ἡ/τό, but demonstratives like *hic* sometimes function article-like. The fanciful etymology—*articulum* as "less than an art" (*arte minus*)—is characteristic wordplay.

Law observes that the pronoun/article distinction became important in medieval grammar as Latin scholars encountered Greek and eventually vernacular languages with true articles. Virgilius's discussion anticipates these later developments.

### Word Order Rules from Aeneas

Aeneas's teaching that nouns may precede verbs only when the verb is "sandwiched" between two nouns reflects attention to Latin word order. The example sentences (*sol in caelo splendet radius*) are syntactically unusual, with both subject and object flanking the verb.

These verses may represent actual stylistic practices in liturgical or poetic Latin, or may be Virgilian inventions illustrating a theoretical principle. Law notes that early medieval Latin did develop distinctive word-order patterns, particularly in hymns and prayers, that differed from classical norms.

### *Ille* for Superior Persons

Aeneas's doctrine that *ille* should refer only to "superior persons" (*non cuiuslibet sed superioris personae*) reflects the demonstrative's honorific use in late Latin. The development of *ille* into the Romance definite article (French *le*, Spanish *el*, Italian *il*) began with such emphatic uses.

The "Homer" verses illustrating this—about "that most wealthy king" and "that powerful one kindling the moon"—are Virgilian compositions in the style of the invented quotations throughout the *Epitomae*. Their elevated diction supports the claim that *ille* marks distinguished referents.

### The Sibyl of Carginea

The reference to reading a passage in "a booklet of the Sibyl of Carginea" (*libello Sibillae Cargineae*) introduces another invented authority. Huemer suggested *Carginea* might be Carthage (*Carthaginiensis*), which would connect to the Sibylline tradition, but no "Sibyl of Carthage" is otherwise known.

Löfstedt treats this as pure invention; Law notes that Sibylline texts circulated widely in the early Middle Ages, and Virgilius may be creating fictional Sibylline material to suit his grammatical purposes.

### The Poet Fabianus

The verse attributed to "the poet Fabianus" (*poeta Fabianus*)—*quantotae tuae tonant carminibus Iuliane uxores aptae*—uses the invented comparative form *quantotus* to praise Julian's wives. The verse is metrically irregular and semantically obscure ("how great your wives resound with songs").

Fabianus appears nowhere else in Latin literature. The verse may be Virgilius's own composition, attributed to a fictional poet to demonstrate usage of his invented forms. The domestic subject matter (wives resounding with songs) is unusual for grammatical examples.

### Diminutive and Derivative Pronouns

The forms *solulus*, *ullulus*, *unulus*, *totulus* (diminutives) and *mealis*, *tualis*, *sualis*, *nostralis*, *uestralis*, *alteralis* (derivatives) are unattested elsewhere. Virgilius's hedge—"I neither disagree nor openly assent" (*nec dissentio nec aperte consentio*)—suggests awareness that these forms are controversial.

Law notes that the theoretical possibility of pronominal diminutives and derivatives follows from treating pronouns as a subtype of nouns. If nouns have diminutives and derivatives, why not pronouns? Virgilius explores the logical consequences without fully committing to them.

### "Homer" as Authority

The citations from "Homer" (*ipseue ab ipso*; the verses about the wealthy king) are not from the actual Greek poet. Throughout the *Epitomae*, "Homer" functions as a generic authority figure, like "Cicero" or "Virgil," whose name lends weight to invented quotations.

Löfstedt argues that Virgilius uses classical names not to claim direct knowledge of classical texts but to create an atmosphere of learned authority. The "Homer" who writes Latin verses about kings using goddesses as spouses is purely Virgilian.

### The Elegant Man from among the Hebrews

The Flaccus quotation about "an elegant man from among the Hebrews" (*elegantem uirum de Hebreis*) is intriguing for its reference to Jews. Combined with other Hebraisms in the *Epitomae* (the *res*/*resh* etymology, the possible *hiboni*/*Hebreorum* reading), it suggests Virgilius's intellectual world included Jewish learning or at least awareness of Jewish traditions.

Bischoff (1961) used such passages to argue for possible Jewish origins or contacts; Law more cautiously notes that Hebrew learning was available through patristic intermediaries without requiring direct Jewish contact.
