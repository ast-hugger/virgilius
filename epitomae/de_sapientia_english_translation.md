### I. ON WISDOM

---

The accounting of our learning makes progress throughout the whole world, because what we reckon is not monetary contracts but the profit of wisdom. Now wisdom (*sapientia*) is so named from taste (*sapor*), because just as there is taste in the body's palate, so too in the motion of the soul there is a certain taste which savors the sweetness of the arts, which discerns the force of words and thoughts, rejecting whatever is bitter but pursuing what is sweet. Indeed, we call "bitter" those things which run contrary to the truth of teachings, but "sweet" those things which furnish the rationale of each art and discipline. This wisdom is twofold: celestial and earthly—that is, humble and sublime. Humble, indeed, is that which treats of human affairs; sublime, however, is that which reveals and lays open those things which are above mankind. Let no one, to be sure, criticize me in this passage for having placed the earthly before the celestial, as if in reversed order, since this is the custom of those who ascend: to begin from lower things and climb step by step toward higher ones.

This is why we arrange the degrees of grammatical comparison the same way: positive (lowest), then comparative, then superlative. The human being illustrates this same twofold wisdom in miniature: we have an earthly body and a celestial soul. The humble part of wisdom should serve the sublime, just as body serves soul. Therefore we who are devoted to philosophy—even though some philosophical teachings may seem to contradict the ancient laws of the Hebrews, which they hold to be divine—do not dare to subordinate sacred things to secular ones. We must always direct our eloquence, skill, zeal, and talent toward supporting and adorning that celestial law. Anyone who defends philosophy in such a way as to rank the authority of Hebrew scripture below this newer, however elegant, discipline wastes all their effort. But having established these principles, let us turn to Latinity itself, the humblest branch of learning.

Now Latinity, as some suppose, is derived from Latinus, as if he were the author of that language. Indeed, Latinus was a certain Anneus, whom they report to have lived two hundred years; but because he flourished in the times of a certain king Belus, and the division of languages occurred long before then, we are compelled to deny that Latinity—being more ancient—took its name from this Latinus. Rather, as it seemed to Aeneas and the ancestors, it is established that it was derived from the breadth (*latitudo*) of the language itself. Finally, when you wish to translate Hebrew or Greek into the Latin language, you will find this one broader in every way—in modes of speech, in sentences, and in syllables. Moreover, this Latinity is called "oration" (*oratio*) on account of the most ornate grace of the orators; hence "parts of speech" (*partes orationis*) should be understood as "parts of Latinity." But truly, those who wish to write "parts of speeches" (*partes orationum*)—I know not by what authority they are emboldened—unless perhaps, as Glengus taught (whom Asporius followed), "speeches" (*orationes*) are to be taken as "discourses" and "utterances," which customarily are divided into eight parts.

Now the types of Latinity are twelve, of which one is in common use, by which all Latins compose their writings. But so that you may have an example of the twelve types, we shall demonstrate by means of one word. In the common Latinity, "fire" is called *ignis* (I), because it ignites all things by its nature. (II) *Quoquihabin*, which is declined thus: genitive *quoquihabis*, dative *quoquihabi*, accusative *quoquihabin* with a macron placed above it, vocative *quoquihabin* with a short mark, ablative *quoquihabi*. And in the plural: *quoquihabis* (lengthened), genitive *quoquihabium*, dative *quoquihabibus*, accusative *quoquihabis*, vocative *quoquihabis*, ablative *quoquihabibus*. We say *quoquihabin* because it has the power of cooking uncooked things. (III) *Ardon* is so called because it burns (*ardeat*). (IV) *Calax*, *calacis*, from heat (*calor*). (V) *Spiridon*, from breathing out (*spiramen*). (VI) *Rusin*, from redness (*rubor*). (VII) *Fragon*, from the crackling (*fragor*) of flame. (VIII) *Fumaton*, from smoke (*fumus*). (IX) *Ustrax*, from burning (*urendo*). (X) *Uitius*, which vivifies nearly dead limbs by its vigor. (XI) *Siluleus*, because it springs forth (*siliat*) from flint; hence "flint" (*silex*) is not properly so called unless a spark springs from it. (XII) *Aeneon*, from the god Aeneas, who dwells in it, or from whom breath is borne to the elements. Thus throughout almost all Latin writings, this sum of types is reckoned.

## TRANSLATOR'S NOTES

### The Opening Sentence

The chapter's first sentence (*Toto proficit in polo nostrae connumeratio litteraturae*) establishes Virgilius's grand claims for grammatical learning: it "makes progress throughout the whole world" (*toto...in polo*). The commercial metaphor continues: *connumeratio* (reckoning, accounting) and *quaestus* (profit, gain) treat wisdom as wealth to be calculated. This valuation of *sapientia* over *pecunia* is a commonplace, but Virgilius's accounting terminology gives it distinctive flavor.

### Wisdom as Taste

The etymology *sapientia* from *sapor* (taste) is traditional—found in Isidore's *Etymologies* and earlier sources. Virgilius's elaboration, however, is distinctively sensory: wisdom involves "savoring" (*gustet*) the sweetness of arts, distinguishing bitter from sweet teachings. The language recalls biblical Wisdom literature (e.g., Psalm 34:8, "taste and see that the Lord is good") filtered through Latin grammatical tradition. The "motion of the soul" (*animae motu*) as the locus of intellectual taste suggests an active, dynamic understanding of learning.

### The Subordination of Philosophy to Scripture

The passage about "not daring to subordinate sacred things to secular ones" (*decelsis celsa subicere*) articulates a key methodological principle: classical *philosophia* must serve, not supplant, revealed *lex*. This reflects the standard early medieval Christian approach to pagan learning—what Augustine called "spoiling the Egyptians"—but Virgilius's formulation contains characteristic paradox. The phrase *decelsis celsa* (literally "lofty things from/below lofty things") plays with near-synonyms to create deliberate ambiguity: is this tautology, wordplay, or a genuine hierarchical distinction? Law suggests the passage reflects Irish scholarly debates about the proper ordering of sacred and secular learning.

The reference to "Hebrew laws" (*Hebreorum legibus*) as "divine" (*divinas*) and promulgated "anciently" (*antiquioribus*) establishes scriptural priority by temporal precedence—a common patristic argument. Philosophy, however "ornate" (*ornatae*), remains a "more recent teaching" (*recentiori sectae*).

### The Etymology of *Latinus*

Virgilius rejects the obvious etymology connecting Latin to the legendary king Latinus, whom he identifies as "a certain Anneus" who lived 200 years in the time of "king Belus." The chronological argument—that the division of languages (Genesis 11, the Tower of Babel) predates any historical Latinus—reflects biblical literalism combined with learned pseudo-history. The reference to Belus connects to Babylonian chronology found in Eusebius's chronicle, suggesting Virgilius had access to world-historical frameworks.

The preferred etymology from *latitudo* (breadth) claims Latin is the most capacious of languages—broader than Hebrew or Greek "in modes of speech, in sentences, and in syllables." This linguistic patriotism contrasts with the frequent patristic privileging of Hebrew as the original divine language, though Virgilius diplomatically maintains Hebrew's doctrinal authority while claiming Latin's formal superiority.

### Aeneas and the Ancestors

Here we meet Virgilius's most frequently cited authority, the mysterious teacher Aeneas, whose opinions appear throughout the *Epitomae* and *Epistolae*. Whether Aeneas represents a real teacher, a literary fiction, or an alter ego of Virgilius himself remains debated. Löfstedt considers him purely fictional; Law suggests he may represent genuine pedagogical traditions; Herren argues for possible historical reality within Irish-connected schools.

### Glengus and Asporius

These two otherwise unknown grammarians are cited on the question of singular *oratio* versus plural *orationes* in the term "parts of speech." Virgilius's characteristic move is to cite obscure authorities whose teachings he then qualifies or supersedes. Glengus and Asporius appear nowhere else in Latin literature; they may be invented, or may preserve names from genuine but now-lost grammatical traditions. The Celtic appearance of "Glengus" has led some scholars to posit Irish or British origins.

### The Twelve Latinities and the Names of Fire

This is perhaps Virgilius's most famous conceit—the claim that Latin exists in twelve different varieties, of which ordinary Latin is merely one. The doctrine, elaborated fully in Chapter XV, here receives only a preliminary demonstration through twelve names for "fire."

The names divide roughly into:
- **Transparent Latin derivatives**: *ignis* (standard), *ardon* (from *ardere*), *calax* (from *calor*), *spiridon* (from *spirare*), *rusin* (from *rubor*), *fragon* (from *fragor*), *fumaton* (from *fumus*), *ustrax* (from *urere*), *uitius* (from *uiuificare*), *siluleus* (from *silex*)
- **Pseudo-Greek or invented forms**: *quoquihabin* (humorously from *coquere*, "to cook"), *aeneon* (connecting fire to the divine Aeneas)

The elaborate declension of *quoquihabin* parodies standard grammatical paradigms while demonstrating that these "Latinities" function as complete linguistic systems, not mere vocabulary lists.

Scholarly interpretation of the twelve Latinities has varied widely:

**Löfstedt** sees them as learned parody—Virgilius mocking the proliferation of grammatical distinctions by inventing absurd linguistic varieties.

**Law** argues the doctrine reflects genuine early medieval theories about linguistic registers, noting parallels with Irish concepts of *bélre* (special languages) used in different social or ritual contexts. The *Auraicept na n-Éces* (Scholars' Primer), an Irish grammatical tract roughly contemporary with Virgilius, similarly discusses multiple varieties of language.

**Herren** connects the twelve Latinities to the *hisperica famina*, enigmatic Hiberno-Latin compositions that deploy obscure vocabulary in ways reminiscent of Virgilius's "philosophical Latin."

**Smyth** suggests cosmological significance: twelve Latinities parallel the twelve signs of the zodiac, embedding grammar within a larger symbolic order.

The twelfth Latinity's connection to "the god Aeneas, who dwells in" fire raises theological questions. Is this Christian allegory (divine presence within creation)? Pagan survival? Playful invention? The epithet "god" (*deo*) applied to Aeneas the teacher may be honorific rather than theological, but the passage remains characteristically ambiguous.

### Key Latin Terms

**Aetrea / tellea**: These adjectives are Virgilius's coinages from Greek αἰθήρ (*aether*, the upper air/heaven) and Latin *tellus* (earth). The excerpta from Clemens Scotus preserved in the apparatus explicitly gloss these as *id est caelestis* (that is, celestial) and *id est terrena* (that is, earthly). This binary framework—heavenly versus earthly wisdom—echoes patristic distinctions between *sapientia divina* and *sapientia mundana*, but Virgilius characteristically invests the categories with his own peculiar terminology.

**Plastum / affla**: The body and soul, respectively. *Plastum* derives from Greek πλάσμα ("molded thing"), recalling Genesis 2:7 where God "forms" (*plasmavit* in the Vulgate) Adam from clay. *Affla* (also spelled *afflam*) comes from *afflare* ("to breathe upon"), reflecting the divine breath that animates the body. This anthropology is thoroughly Christian, depicting humans as composite beings of earthly matter animated by divine spirit. Law (1995) notes that Virgilius's terminology here shows familiarity with patristic exegesis on the creation narrative.

**Parilla**: A diminutive coinage meaning "small likeness" or "image." The formation is characteristically Virgilian—creating diminutives to suggest that earthly realities are small reflections of heavenly archetypes.

**Minula**: An invented term that appears to mean "discipline" or "teaching," perhaps derived from *minus* (smaller) to indicate a subordinate branch of learning. Virgilius uses it twice in this chapter: first for the "first Hebrew discipline" (*primae Hebreorum minulae*), then for Latinity itself as "the smallest discipline of learning" (*minula sapidinis est minima*). The double diminutive *minula...minima* is typical of Virgilius's playful style.

**Pada**: Likely meaning "passage" or "section" of a text. Herren (1979) connects this to Irish pedagogical terminology.
