# XIII. ON THE SPLITTING OF WORDS

Aeneas was first among us accustomed to split words. When I was inquiring of him most diligently why he did this, he said: "O son, for three reasons are words split. The first is that we may test the acuteness of our students in seeking out and finding those things which are obscure. The second is for the beauty and edification of eloquence. The third is lest any mystic things, and those which ought to be revealed only to the knowing, be easily found everywhere by the lowest and foolish—lest, according to the ancient saying, pigs trample gems. For if they learn this sect, not only will they show no piety to their teachers, no honor or reverence will they bestow, but indeed in the manner of swine they will tear apart their own adorners."

The effect of splitting, however, is threefold. **The first** is that by which we split verses, as Cato says: *mare oceanum classes quod longae sepe turbatur simul nauigant* ("The ocean sea fleets which long often is disturbed together sail"). For he ought to have said: *mare oceanum sepe turbatur, classes quod longae simul nauigant* ("The ocean sea is often disturbed, which long fleets sail together").

**The second** is that by which we split the words themselves or syllables, as Lucanus produced: *-ge- ues- ro- trum- quando- tum- a- fec- om- ni- libet- aeuo-* and thus it is solved: *quandolibet uestrum gero omni aeuo affectum* ("Whenever I bear affection for you in every age").

**The third** kind is that by which we split letters. The splitting of letters, however, is superfluous; but nevertheless it is received by those of subtle glyphs and sense. Whence also it is more suitable to split short words than long ones. Cicero says: *rrr- ss- pp- mm- nt- ee- oo- a- v- l*, which is to be solved thus: **SPES ROMANORVM PERIT** ("The hope of the Romans perishes"). Virgilius Assianus also: *gggg- l- b- ff- rr- s- nnn- tt- e- ae- l vvv- ee-* which is solved thus: **GLEBAE GIGNVNT, FRVGES FERVNT** ("The soils produce, the crops bear"). Emilius the rhetor also elegantly says: *sss- sss- sss- ss- pp- nnnn- gggg- rr- mm- ct- td- cc- cc- cc- cc- cc- cc- cc- iii- ii- vvvv- vvvv- ee- ae- eeee- ee-* whose solution is this: **sapiens sapientiae sanguinem sugens sanguissuga uenarum factae uocandus est** ("A wise man must be called a leech of the blood of wisdom, a bloodsucker of the veins"). Galbungus also, weaving long lines in praise of the *indefuncti*, in his proem thus spoke: *pppp- ppp- rrr- rrr- lm- sss- nn- ttt- c- iiii- aaaaa- o- eee- eee-* which is solved thus: **primae partis procerae partes pleni pupis erant** ("The lofty parts of the first part were full of the poop deck").

Furthermore, there are many who, after the manner of notaries, are accustomed to note down parts of Latinity—by a dissimilar writing indeed—with either single or double letters. As Virgilius Troianus to Auiceanus on a royal secret: *tibi si liberali omnem fertilitatem in agris, prolitatem in filiis, mulitatem in coniugibus, benedictionem in pecoribus per deos o* ("To you, if liberal, all fertility in fields, abundance in sons, multitude in wives, blessing in cattle, through the gods *o*"). He put one letter for the whole active verb which ends in *-o*, that is, *opto* (I wish). And Cicero concerning the sun: *magnum inquit laminare, quod totum circuit polum sol -ur-* ("A great luminary," he says, "which circles the whole pole, is the sun *-ur-*"); he put this for *nominatur* (is called).

Many furthermore split words for this purpose: that they may strive to compose and arrange them through syllables into certain arts. As Lucius on the noun: *nomen inquit in modos scindamus latinos ut mon, quod est signum grecum, nomo mone enne et ar* ("Let us split," he says, "the noun into Latin modes, such as *mon*, which is a Greek sign, *nomo*, *mone*, *enne*, and *ar*").

We ought to know that the philosophical account of the Latin arts has changed many words of all the arts; just as in verbs we find either superfluous addition or corruptible diminution: addition, when we find *rogauissem* or *rogauisse* written with a middle syllable added for *rogassem* and *rogasse*; diminution, when with the middle syllable likewise subtracted it is written *rogarunt* for *rogauerunt*, so *rogarant* for *rogauerant* and *rogarit* for *rogauerit*. Rhetors also are accustomed to add some syllables in modes for the sake of measuring feet and times, as is that: *rii uoluimus ionicum nauigabere pontum* ("*Rii* we wished to sail the Ionian *nauigabere* sea")—he put this for *nauigare*. The same elsewhere: *flamma aurum accensi probabat camini* ("The flame *probabat* the gold of the burning furnace")—for *probat*. They have also been accustomed to read nouns or pronouns with other letters in a manner far different from what was proper, such as *bonum* which should be *buonum*, and *ago* for *ego*, which we find in many places. Many have wanted to give another name to this pronoun, one which is closer in letters: *mius mei mihi*—this for *ego*. Who could encompass the various and manifold differences of Latinities, when they are so many that they cannot be numbered?

All parts of speech are accustomed to be split: **nouns**, so that where *regnum* (kingdom) is, *germen* may be put, as Lucanus says: *germen Romanorum rectum est* ("The shoot of the Romans is upright")—that is, *regnum*. **Pronouns** also are split, such as *si* for *is*, according to that saying of Alexander: *saluus sit, si qui contulit* ("May he be well, *si* who contributed")—that is, "*is* who contributed." **Verbs** also we split, such as *nodo* for *dono* and *gelo* for *lego*. **Adverbs** also, according to Hilarius: *locutus summus rhei* ("we spoke the highest *rhei*")—for *heri* (yesterday). **Participles** also they used to split when necessity compelled, as Cicero says: *sapientiam manas in actus exerit* ("wisdom puts forth *manas* into acts")—for *amans*. **Conjunctions** also are split, according to that saying of Cicero: *quasiunt uiues uita odibili* ("you will live *quasiunt* a hateful life")—*quasiunt* for *quatiunt*. **Prepositions** also are split, as Terrentius says: *quidque faciemus abs te* ("what shall we do *abs* you")—that is to say, *absque te quid faciemus* ("without you what shall we do"). Likewise: *nesi Deo in hac uiuitur colonia* ("*nesi* God one lives in this colony")—and this is *sine* (without). **Interjections** also are split, such as *tata* for *atat*.

Let each one of the skilled splitters know this: that he ought to take care of this first of all, that however he splits, the solution may prove how he splits; for it is not rightly solved by anyone after something that is not rightly placed before. Then whence he ought to presume to split Greek or Hebrew nouns or verbs, since this is not held in either language.

Cicero used to split words thus: that he placed the middle of a word in the first verse, and another middle in the second verse, according to that: *in que cuncti manebant simul collecti -do- iura ineuntes foedera munientes -mo-*—that is, *in domo* ("in a house"). He sometimes changed according to his custom, so that not only in endings but also in the middle or first parts of verses he would often insert split words, according to that: *hostes proponunt, o ciues, -da- dextras, uestro uersa iuri -re- uoce, gubernanti fato*—that is, *dare* ("to give"). And again: *-sur- sol succurrere clara fulgens luce -ge- gaudium ciuili pro portantibus salute*—that is, *surge sol* ("rise, sun"). This Cicero did in disyllables.

Likewise in trisyllables: *debeo ciuibus meam rem communibus -fac-, nec auaritiam secter in propriis -ce- malam, neu rapinam agam in externis -re-*—here he splits *facere* ("to do"). And again: *omne uisum ab homine -cu- delectabile natura sugante -pi- ipsi indita, ex quo non potest -ter- cupidine carere*—here he splits *cupiter*. Likewise he made a thoroughly cut prose thus: *-lau- contemptus pecuniae -da- in omni molimine -bi- per amorem philosophiae -lis- menti fiet perite*—that is, *laudabilis* ("praiseworthy").

Terrentius, changing the custom, drawing a syllable from this verse and another from that, either exchanged or diminished and added, according to that: *tempora -quae- -ra- praesuum suo sub iure finem finitum sibi -runt- mundi compage statuta*—that is, *quaerunt tempora praefinitum finem* ("times seek a predetermined end"). Likewise: *fortis ensem Aeneas forte portabat in -nu- pelta fidens -ma- tuta tela festim uincebat*—which is thus: *ensem in manu portabat* ("he was carrying a sword in his hand").

Varro also was seen to move letters through ten verses, according to that: *utinam, o uiri, dolorem pro uestris* **P**- *sicut pro suo genetrix gnato sustinet* -**A**-*; quis enim forti non dolet amico* -**T**-*, cum eum in multis uideat iniuste torqueri* -**E**-*? Cur ergo ne uos quidem hoc iusto uiuitis affectu* -**R**-*, uestris ut pro uestram cito hauriatis gazam* -**E**- *redimendis, quos iniqua proripuerat praeda* -**M**- *iniquorum ditioni, plebi superbitanti?* -**I**- *Noli itaque uestris parcere diuitiis* -**N**-*, cum sit magis cunctis bonus opibus amicus* -**I**-. Here the first word of the phrase, **PATEREMINI**, has been split.

Let us not therefore think it a new custom to split words, since it has been accustomed to happen from antiquity—which can be discovered by those who survey all the Italian and African schools, indeed the Latin schools placed in whatever part of the world. By these also another kind of splitting is accustomed to be taken up: that from two words which ought to be joined, with the first syllable taken from each, one word may be made—just as when we wish to teach order and faith, *orfi* is briefly named. Likewise when one explains life and discipline, *uidis* is chiefly pronounced. As the old man Donatus introduced: *uidi muesam*—who would understand? For they are accustomed to add another syllable from another word to an intact noun for the sake of supplement, such as *suaptum*; for *su* has been taken from *suauitas* (sweetness).

There are furthermore many kinds of splitting which teachers have handed down scattered in their books; yet none of them, I think, has produced a work of this exposition all the way to me. Therefore you do this which Aeneas had done for Vestra, offering to his wife a little song of thanksgiving for thanks to be given, who for him from *ropha* and *scephora* mixed with oil had made a *fer* almost unused by mortals, saying: "My wife, my riches, my glory, my grace, my breath—what thanks shall I repay to you, who have contrived to make for me a feast which not even the Roman kings themselves use?" If therefore the poet gives thanks for lowly vegetables, what thanks is it fitting to repay to our teachers for such sweet feasts of wisdom?

There are other laws of splitting, which nevertheless, because they are worn, I would wish to pass over in silence. But lest anyone consider himself defrauded even of a small gift, I shall put before you one testimony of this matter, which will give a close to my epitome. Let us take an example from hyperbaton, which is accustomed to place multiform and various interceptions of other little sentences in the same sentence upon what has been said; which fault indeed has a perverted order, yet almost immutably grows into authority through all the texts of readings.

Among which is that saying of Aeneas tearfully narrating the history—nay, the tragedy—of the Mithridatic War: "In that," he says, "indeed we propose to narrate (in what meter? dactylic) what we know to be the greatest war waged. In that, I say, and the same time in which I had completed the twenty-fifth year of my age (for Aeneas taught me that this was so), Blastus, a certain one Phrygian by race, an Iulian (which name he received from the poets because he seemed almost to devour men on account of his excessive savagery, which the Blasti are said to do); this one therefore from the north (for from this part he was destined to arise), coming to Rome with German satellites joined to himself—whose alliance and friendship he had equally acquired—with immense destruction made to the city's people and plebs through him, he divided the city into seven parts about to fight against each other and struck an intolerable blow, so that almost the whole city gave itself over to annihilation."

This order, however, of almost the whole testimony has been inverted; which we therefore leave indifferently, because both it is in anyone's power to arrange as he pleases, and the end of this little exposition is near. But it is the mark of wise writers to split words according to these examples which we have proposed.

## TRANSLATOR'S NOTES

### *Scinderatio*: Three Interpretations

The chapter on word-splitting (*scinderatio fonorum*) has puzzled scholars since Mai's 1815 edition. Three interpretations have been proposed:

**Cryptographic**: A system of secret writing to conceal meaning from the uninitiated. Herren (1979) connects this to Hiberno-Latin traditions of secret languages (*hisperica famina*).

**Pedagogical**: Exercises for teaching grammar through puzzle-solving. Law (1995) emphasizes the educational context, suggesting these were classroom games.

**Parodic**: Löfstedt (1984) reads the entire section as satirical exaggeration of grammatical obscurantism.

### Aeneas's Three Reasons for Splitting

Aeneas's explicit justification—testing students' acuteness, beautifying eloquence, and hiding mysteries from the unworthy ("lest pigs trample gems")—is striking. The third reason presents grammatical knowledge as esoteric wisdom requiring concealment.

The warning that those who learn this "sect" (*secta*) without proper reverence "will tear apart their own adorners in the manner of swine" suggests quasi-religious initiation. The language echoes Matthew 7:6 ("cast not your pearls before swine"), embedding grammatical practice within Christian moral discourse.

### The Letter Puzzles

The letter-frequency puzzles are genuinely solvable:

- Cicero's sequence = **SPES ROMANORVM PERIT** ("The hope of the Romans perishes")
- Virgilius Assianus's sequence = **GLEBAE GIGNVNT, FRVGES FERVNT** ("The soils produce, the crops bear")

Law notes these resemble medieval cryptographic games and may connect to Irish ogham traditions, where letters had numerical and symbolic values. The solutions require counting letter frequencies and arranging them into words.

### Galbungus's Verse for the *Indefuncti*

Galbungus "weaving long lines in praise of the *indefuncti*" (*in laudibus indefunctorum longas lineas texens*) presents a textual puzzle. The word *indefunctorum* is ambiguous: *defunctus* means "deceased" (one who has finished life), but the prefix *in-* could be either negative ("not deceased" = still living) or intensive (reinforcing "deceased").

If negative, this would mean "in praise of the living"—perhaps honorific verse for living patrons using funerary-style cryptographic techniques. If intensive or a scribal error for *defunctorum*, it means "in praise of the deceased"—memorial poetry requiring decipherment.

The solemn tone of the puzzle's solution and the context of elaborate letter-games suggest funerary or commemorative practice, but the possibility of praise for the living should not be excluded. This ambiguity may be deliberately Virgilian.

### The Invented Pronoun *Mius*

The pronoun *mius mei mihi* as "closer in letters" to *ego* exemplifies Virgilius's approach: Latin could have developed differently, and alternative forms illuminate the arbitrariness of actual usage. Such invented paradigms function as thought experiments about linguistic possibility.

### Varro's Acrostic: PATEREMINI

The ten-verse passage whose initial letters spell **PATEREMINI** ("you would suffer" or "allow") is an elaborate acrostic. Whether the historical Varro composed such verses or this is Virgilian invention is uncertain, but the technique itself—distributing a word letter by letter across verse-initial positions—is attested in ancient and medieval practice.

### Portmanteau Words

The practice of combining first syllables—*orfi* = *ordo* + *fides*, *uidis* = *uita* + *disciplina*—resembles modern portmanteau formation. Such "abbreviated" vocabulary may reflect actual scholarly shorthand or Virgilian invention, but the principle of morphological creativity is sound.

### Aeneas's Thanksgiving to Vestra

The passage where Aeneas offers his wife Vestra a "little song of thanksgiving" (*gratutum cantilicum*) for her cooking is unique in grammatical literature. The dish made from *ropha* and *scephora* mixed with oil—terms possibly Hebrew or invented—was "almost unused by mortals" and surpassed even royal cuisine.

This domestic scene—husband praising wife's cooking—humanizes the austere world of grammar. Virgilius's moral draws the analogy: if Aeneas thanks his wife for vegetables, how much more should students thank teachers for "sweet feasts of wisdom"?

### The "Mithridatic War" and Blastus

The chapter concludes with Aeneas narrating a garbled "Mithridatic War"—actually the story of Blastus, a Phrygian savage from the north with German allies who divided Rome into seven warring factions. This combines elements of Mithridates, barbarian invasions, and apocalyptic imagery.

The name Blastus (from Greek βλαστός, "sprout") is explained through folk etymology as from the Blasti who "devour men"—a tribe of cannibals whose name ironically means "offspring."

The autobiographical note—"the twenty-fifth year of my age (for Aeneas taught me that this was so)"—creates a curious loop: Virgilius says Aeneas taught him Aeneas's own age. This may be textual corruption, deliberate paradox, or a hint about the relationship between author and teacher.

### Italian and African Schools

The reference to "Italian and African schools, indeed Latin schools placed in whatever part of the world" (*scolas Italicas totas Africanasque, immo in quacumque poli parte positas latinas*) suggests awareness of a geographically dispersed Latin educational network. This supports dating Virgilius to the seventh century, when such networks still existed but were increasingly fragmented by political disruption.
