# V. ON THE NOUN

*[Translator's note: Latin* nomen *encompasses both what English distinguishes as "nouns" and "adjectives"—the substantive and the adjectival. Latin grammarians recognized this distinction (*nomen substantiuum* vs. *nomen adiectum*), but treated both as species of a single part of speech. This chapter accordingly discusses diminutives, derivatives, comparison, and gender—categories applying to adjectives as much as nouns. Virgilius treats the *nomen* as the "principal part of Latinity," privileging it over the verb—a position he defends at length. The chapter is also notable for containing the most personal reminiscences of Virgilius's teacher Aeneas.]*

Being about to publish a brief epitome on the noun, I must first pay out to those complaining why the noun should be preferred to all parts of Latinity, when in the speaking and composition of the *hiboni* the verb is esteemed to hold the primacy. On this matter Aeneas published ten books, from which I think it opportune to take but one point. "Why is it," he says, "that the noun is the beginning according to sense, not according to appellation? For when a human being is born, before he does or learns or knows anything, a name is given to him." The noun, therefore, is the principal part of Latinity. I shall attempt to treat the force of its quality, which first belongs to it.

The quality of nouns is not bipartite, as some think, but multipartite; it consists indeed of various and many species. Some, however, constantly raise questions about proper and appellative nouns, as if there were some noun that is properly Latin. For all Latin nouns—indeed, all words—are so interconnected with one another that each clings to another just as it is called by another. Proper nouns, therefore, are not to be sounded according to their simple sound, but according to a certain subtler interpretation. For "propriety" signifies two things: either speciality or a nearer order. For those are rightly called *proprii* (leading citizens) who are enrolled in honor or dignity or census at the founding of cities; whence also Cicero, writing about a certain Justinus, a Roman, thus begins: *Iustinus autem proprius omnium sese obdedit*—that is, "first of all." Properly, therefore, nouns are to be called primary, such as *Roma* and *Carthago*. But common nouns are of an inferior order, such as *ciuitas* (city).

Concerning "thing" (*res*) and "body" (*corpus*), many hesitate. *Res* is a Hebrew letter which is interpreted as "head." *Res*, therefore, is the same as a primary noun. Just as, therefore, the lower army is led by any primary commander, so also every body is ruled by the head. Appellative nouns, however, have many-branched species; for some nouns are principal, such as *rex* (king), and some are called "primative" and are found unchanged for many reasons afterward; for some are given on account of victory, some on account of dignity, some on account of infamy, and not a few on account of love. For when Scipio had conquered the Africans in war and received them in surrender, Scipio himself was called Africanus. Gordonus, on account of the wealth and dignity of the Misani, over whom he presided, was also called Misanus; Mantanus too, on account of the greed and voracity which are native to Tantalus, was called Tantalicus. My uncle Samminius, however, because he was *goela* to his mother—that is, "delightful"—is called Goelanus to this day.

There are other *agnomina*, which are called from fields, such as the Parthi from Parthe. The rule of *cognomina* is twofold: for a name which is given afterward, while the first and still unchangeable name remains, is called a *cognomen*—such as Paulus Fabius. Many *cognomina*, however, are called from blood kinship, such as Saurinus from the Sauri. But having passed over many species of quality, we must come to the necessary ones.

Nouns of the first state are immovable, which are added to nothing, such as *rex*; but diminutives, although they too are immovable, nevertheless very often differ in gender from those nouns to which they cling. Sometimes, however, they agree: for you say *taberna*, from which is made diminutively *tabernaculum*. Also *poera* is said, from which comes *periculum*, which the Latins did not well change when, taking *n* for *r*, they called it *poena*. There is *lapis*, from which you have *lapicula*. But those which agree are many, such as *hostium hostiolum*, *riuus riuulus*, *flagum flagellum*—in which some superfluously add *r* so that it becomes *flagrum*, for *flagrum* which "flags" is a smell. *Fer* makes *ferculum*, for *fer* is a banquet and is thus declined *fer feris* and makes *fera*; *bax* makes *baculus*. But *macula* and *tabula*, *fibula*, *macellum*, *uinculum*, *garbellum*, *quircula*—because they do not have nouns of the first position—are not easily believed to be diminutives. But Cicero used to say that these were diminutives from sense, not from letter.

Derivatives, however, are not of one kind; for some end in the syllable *-nus*, such as *terrenus* from *terra*, *montanus* from *monte*; some in *-cus*, especially those which are derived from regions and peoples and sects, such as *Macidonicus*, *Sarmaticus*, *Germanicus*, *gramaticus*, and so forth; some in *-tis*, such as *celestis*, *leuitis*; some in *-eus*, such as *igneus*; some in *-ius*, such as *Aegiptius*; some in *-lis*, such as *carnalis*, *animalis*. It should be known that all derivative nouns are always adjectives.

A few things must be said about comparison. The positive degree serves the genitive, although through solecism, yet it does the work of the superlative—such as *sapiens sapientum* (wise one of the wise), as if one were saying *sapientissimus sapientum* (wisest of the wise). Sometimes also the comparative degree, when it adheres to the genitive case, does the work of the superlative—and this is not from reason but from antiquity—for you say *maior omnium* (greater of all), as if you had said *maximus* (greatest). And conversely, when the superlative degree has been joined with the plural ablative, it will be taken as comparative; but this is barbaric, as Don says: *tu es omnibus fortissimus regibus* (you are the most brave of all kings)—this means "braver than all."

Concerning the comparative, however, no small question arises: whether the same degree ought to serve the ablative case of both numbers, or only the singular—some confessing that it receives both cases, others denying that without the singular ablative it has any case which it may rightly serve. I, following Aeneas, whom it was possible to deceive in no reasoning, confidently assert that the comparative degree most rightly serves the ablative case of both numbers. The comparative degree ought not to be joined to the nominative case without the adverb of comparing, which is *quam*. The positive degree is put for the comparative barbarically, as Horatius once writing to me thus spoke: *suo magnus doctore* (great by his teacher) for *maior* (greater); and again in Flaccus we read *rationabilis omnibus* (reasonable to all) for *rationabilior* (more reasonable). But although these do not present to us undoubted authority, nevertheless because they have been used by very many most learned men, they ought not to bring open disapproval.

The comparative degree is most incongruously placed before the superlative, as *maior maximo* (greater than the greatest): for the superlative rides over all just as the positive sits under all. The comparative, however, is a certain middle step of the ladder, both higher than the positive and lower than the superlative—a degree which is positive in surface but superlative in quality, such as *praecipuus*, *egregius*, and *cernuus*. For we say *praecipuus omnium* (outstanding of all), *egregius patrum* (distinguished of the fathers), *cernuus regum* (bowed of kings).

Now we must treat of the gender of nouns. There are four-formed genders, as is evident to all readers. First masculine, second feminine, and it is thus arranged because according to ancient laws the man was preferred to the woman; neuter, however, is so called because both in declension and in quality it is said to be neither openly masculine nor absolutely feminine. But the common gender is twofold. For there are nouns common to masculine and feminine gender, such as *sacerdos*, *dies*, *finis*, *renis*, *lacus*; but when it is of masculine gender, *lacus* is thus declined: *lacus laci laco*; so *acus aci aco*; so *domus domi domo*, and it makes *domorum domis*. But in the feminine it is said *lacus*, so *acus*, *domus*, and makes *domuum domibus*. *Lapes*, *pulues*, *cines* are masculine; *lapis*, *puluis*, *cinis* are feminine; but the declension is the same. Common nouns to masculine and neuter are also found, such as *fulgor*, *murmor*, *frigus*, *buxus*. There are also common nouns to feminine and neuter, such as *tellus*, *holus*.

No proper name of any animal or bird can have a proper gender before it is discerned what gender it is—except only for those which have proper names set down in both genders, such as *taurus* and *uacca*, *bos bouis*, *aries* and *ouis*. But nouns which are suited to all genders ought to be called not common but *omnigena* ("of all genders"), such as *felix*, *uelox*, *uerax*, *amens*, *diues*, *prudens*.

Concerning numbers, however, this only must be said: that, setting aside obvious singularity and plurality, many common nouns are found for either number, such as *sepes*, *nubes*, *dies*, *clades*, *fames*, *sedes*, *uultus*, *tribus*, *gressus*, and so forth. But *terra* (earth), in which is the race of men, *turba* (crowd), *tribus* (tribe), *populus* (people), *plebs* (common people), *contio* (assembly)—although they display a singular number—are nevertheless manifested as plural from sense. Whence they ought also to be applied to verbs of the plural number, as Cicero speaks: *audite plebs et intendite tribus* (hear, O people, and attend, O tribes).

Figures, moreover, are two: simple and compound. But the composition of nouns sometimes works to a good sense, sometimes to a bad one: for when you say *impius*, he is worse than *pius*; but when you say *impiger* and *inlustris*, he is better than the lazy and brighter than the *lustris*—that is, the ignoble. The composition of nouns, however, is made through "modes," which modes are either whole or corrupt. But integrity is not to be sought in corrupt modes, just as it is not to be taken away from whole ones; for they are called corrupt not because they were whole before, but because they cannot be said alone in Latin. We read, Aeneas saying, that these modes of composition do not exceed the number of two or three letters. For we say *tribus* with three modes, the last corrupt; *insulsus* with the middle corrupt—though many measure these nouns by two modes.

There are nouns which, having received composition, change the middle vowel letter, which in simple nouns is the first of the syllable—such as *salsus insulsus*, *barbatus inberbis*, *dampnatus indempnis*, *minatus inmunis*. Monosyllabic nouns, however, cannot be compounded except for adjectives, such as *ers iners*, *sons insons*. But other nouns of the first position, just as they cannot be compounded, so they cannot be distinguished by modes, because these modes which we speak of are syllables, such as *ars* and *mons*.

When Aeneas wished to imbue me, still an inquiring and inexperienced student, clearly, whenever he wrote for me the modes of nouns, syllables, feet, and meters, he would inform me thus with dots interposed: impressing one dot with the first foot's stamp, and thus according to the increase or number of modes the addition of dots would also be fixed. And since mention of Aeneas himself comes up, I shall bring forth to you in few words his admonitory sayings, which on account of his long absence I cannot speak without tears.

He used to say to me: "O Virgil, first the stars!—lest you believe in your own inventions rather than in the examples of your teachers. For the more one's own authority is defended, the more it is discovered to be shameful falsehood." He also used to say: "Never spend any whole day or whole night ever away from the studies of wisdom, because even if you interrupt reading for one day or night and begin to read again on the morrow, you will find the sharpness of sense somewhat dulled, however small. For the attention of reading acquires the increases of sharpening the mind." This above all he used to instill in me: that I should not be held by the desire of gathering money. "For just as water is the extinguisher of fire, and just as darkness blocks light, so also the desire for money makes the sense of the wise incapable and devoid of skill."

But since I judge that to commemorate all his teachings is beyond the capacity of this time or style or my ability, I shall set forth one saying of his, which may perhaps benefit readers. One day when I was secretly asking him what the difference was between *causa*, *res*, and *ratio*, having heaved a sigh he at last spoke thus: "What does it matter, O son? For if I shall determine it, as I know, what will it profit, when either the ignorance of writers or the custom of antiquity has disturbed all the instruments of the elders? But nevertheless, since it has seemed good to you to ask, hear: *ratio* is whatever looks to judgment and discernment. *Causa* is twofold, for it is spoken either of 'causation' or of 'caution.' But *res* is generally understood as whatever in the creation of the world either has been done or is engaged in happening."

Thus Aeneas. Now the discourse on case must be drawn out a little longer.

There are six cases. Why? Because humans conduct six businesses: they name, they generate, they give, they do, they call, they take away. Whence these cases also receive this sum. Nominative: *hic Plato dicit* ("This Plato says"). Genitive: *huius Platonis dicta fuerunt* ("The sayings of this Plato were"). Dative: *huic Platoni placuit dicere* ("It pleased this Plato to speak"). Accusative: *hunc Platonem ferunt dixisse* ("They say this Plato said"). Vocative: *o Plato uere dixisti* ("O Plato, you spoke truly"). Ablative: *ab hoc Platone dictum fertur* ("It is said to have been spoken by this Plato").

Concerning the accusative case, they ask what it is. Most of our people have frequently used this word—that is, accusing. For Cicero thus says: *accusate quod rectum est* (accuse what is right)—that is, "do it." Terrentius also: *quare non accusatis paenitudinem?* (why do you not accuse repentance?)—that is, "why do you not do it?" Gelbidius also concerning Ambrosius: *omnia inquit laude accusauit digna* (he accused all things worthy of praise), meaning "he did." Whence it is understood that the accusative case is so called because it clings to an active verb. And I shall speak more truly: the accusative itself will be the "active" case.

But concerning the seventh case, what shall we say, when so many have written about it that now nothing is more certain? We, however, say this: that the seventh case differs from the ablative only in this, that the ablative receives a preposition, but the seventh case clings to certain cases and certain verbs. For you say in the ablative case: *ab hac regione uenerunt* (they came from this region); but in the seventh: *hac regione praediti sunt* (they are endowed with this region)—just as *laude digni* (worthy of praise) and *arte macti* (honored in skill).

There are many nouns which, content with the nominative alone, are deprived of the other cases, such as *pus*, *rogs*, *als*, *muls*; just as also those which are declined only in the nominative and genitive plural, such as *uires uirum* (forces, of men)—whose other declension is complete, although used from custom, not from reason, such as *uir uiri uiro* and so forth. There is another noun which lacks the genitive singular, such as *humus*; for *humi* is dative. There are also other nouns which have nominative, accusative, and vocative—such as *glos glorem o glos*; for reason does not receive the others; so also *cers cerem o cers*. There are others which, except for the ablative, have no case in the singular number, but enjoy all in the plural—such as *ab hoc uiscere* and *ab hoc uerbere*.

There are also those which, except for nominative and vocative, are declined only in the singular number through the remaining cases, yet not having a plural number—such as *dicionis dicioni dicionem dicione*; so *alliuionis*. There are others which, except for the accusative singular, are declined through all cases of both numbers, such as *tenebra*—whence our people are also accustomed always to apply *tenebras* to an active verb. But nevertheless, when *tenebra* is said, a certain rust made in the day is understood; but *tenebrae* are the most dense and most profound darknesses of nights. *Diuitiae*, however, cannot have a singular number. *Iuuentus* and *senectus* are not declined in the plural number.

There are also nouns which are declined one way by the ancients and now, as if restored by more recent skill, are declined another way—such as *uis uis ui uim uis ui*, and in the plural *uis uium uibus uis uis uibus*. But we say *uirs uiris uiri uirim uirs uiri*, and in the plural *uires* and so forth. They also used to say *gelus gelus gelui gelum gelus gelu*, not *gelu gelu* and so forth. There are those who say that *unicornis* should always be declined; but we have found *unicornus* and so forth.

It should indeed be known that every monosyllabic declension uses a double nominative—such as *plebs plebis* and, as nominative, *plebis*; *ars* and *artis*; *bos* and *bouis*. There is another noun which has a double declension and double quality—such as *nas naris nari narem* and the rest. There is also *nas natis nati natem nas nati*. The ancients used to say that all openings of the body were called *nas*. *Sol* is not forbidden to be declined in either number, but in the singular number *sol* will be the luminary itself; but *soles* we call those days in which the sun illuminates the whole heaven. Some of the ancients, however, called their very songs *soles*, just as Horatius at the beginning of a certain volume thus began: *soles meos omni ecclesiae uestrae commendo* (I commend my suns to your whole church).

There are also certain nouns which seem to many to be defective, which the reason of reading annuls—such as *uas* and *spes*, *chors*, *mas*. But *uas* varies in declension: for some, thinking the genitive *uassi* and the ablative *uasso*, and in the plural *uassorum uassis*, have thought it should be declined thus. But we, following the decrees of the learned, are not led by vulgar opinions. The learned indeed have handed down to us the declension of this noun in this manner: *uas uassis uassi uas uasse*, and in the plural *uassa uassum uassibus uassa uassa uassibus*.

This indeed should be considered: that many neuter nouns have two declensions—such as *fundamen fundaminis* and so forth. Likewise *fundamentum -ti -to*; so also *stramen* and *stramentum*, *cognomen cognomentum*, *specimen specimentum*, *crassamen crassamentum*, and so forth, which are declined in *-n*. Likewise *altare -ris* and *altarium -rii*, *praesepe praesepium*, *simile similium*, *terribile terribilium*, *mirabile mirabilium*. There are also feminine nouns which enjoy a double declension—such as *materies* and *materia*, *temperies temperantia*, *caluities caluitia* (though there is also *caluitium*), *segnities segnitia*, *laetities laetitia*, *requies requia*, *facies facia*.

But there is much difference between these: for *materies* belongs to crafts and *materia* to counsels; so *temperies* to breezes and *temperantia* to morals. *Caluities* is natural, *caluitia* of grief, *caluitium* of art. *Segnities* is of vice, *segnitia* of cold. *Laetities* is of sudden benefit, *laetitia* familiar. *Requies* is refreshment from labor, *requia* of idleness. *Facies* is the surface itself, *facia* a likeness of the face in painting. *Origo originis* is a beginning; but *origo origonis* is neuter and is a sail of a ship, and has *origona* in the plural number. *Cantarus* is an animal; *cantarum* a chamber of a house. *Domuncula* is a chamber of a house; *domicilium* a nest of a bird. *Diluuium* is an immoderate flooding of water; *deluuium* is sanctification.

Original nouns, from which verbs are born, end in *-o*—yet only thus if they have ended in *-o*, turning back. Otherwise, verbs ending in *-m* will have originals in *-a*—such as *potentia*, *essentia*, *praesentia*, *absentia*, from which are *possum*, *sum*, *praesum*, *absum*. But the affinities of nouns and verbs seem to me to have a likeness to human genealogy, by which we say father and son, grandson and great-grandson. In place of father, hold the original noun—such as *glorificatio*; for son, the verb *glorifico*; for grandson, the noun of the first position born from the verb, *gloria*; for great-grandson, the adjective noun coming from the aforesaid noun—such as *gloriosus gloriosa gloriosum*. So *oratio oro oratorium orator oratrix*; but because they come from a neuter noun, therefore they do not have a third gender.

If, however, they have come from the feminine gender, they will have three genders in adjectives—such as *beatitudo*, from which is born *beatus beata beatum*. Attend to this also: that all originals which have *a* before the last syllable will always beget verbs of the first conjugation—such as *oratio oro oras*. But if they have *i* before the same syllable, they cause verbs of the third long conjugation to come from themselves—such as *eruditio erudio*. But the originals of verbs of the second conjugation and third short have an undistinguished rule.

Between *operatio*, *opus*, and *opera* there is this difference: that *operatio* belongs to signs, *opus* is general for every office, but *opera* in the singular number is laborious care, which especially tortures the soul. Some think that *locus* is of masculine gender and *loca* of neuter; the authority of reading does not agree with them. For we often find *locus* in masculine gender, which has *locos* in the plural, and in neuter gender *locum*, which makes *loca*; so also *iocus* and in the plural *ioci*; likewise *iocum* makes *ioca*. *Regia* will be the hall of a king; *regnum* is in the substance itself.

There are cases of extraordinary declension—such as *opia opiae*, and in the plural *opes*. But in compounds of the figure, both cases remain whole in their state—that is, *inopia* and *inops*, *bonus* and *bonis*. Both are found in their own declension, as Lucanus says: *bones uiros urbs dedit Sicilia* (Sicily the city gave good men); and again Serenus: *sanctem deorum cultorem quis non laudabit* (who will not praise the holy worshipper of the gods?). Likewise: *con eundem perfectem in cunctis oportet crescere uirum* (with him the perfect man in all things ought to grow). We should know, therefore, that these things are somewhat rare; the teachers set them down for this reason—not because they wished to harm their hearers, but to benefit them, so that when we see these things written in their works, we may have them as familiar and known in use.

## TRANSLATOR'S NOTES

### The Priority of the Noun over the Verb

Virgilius opens with an argument for noun-primacy against those who privilege the verb. His reasoning—that a child receives a name before doing anything—reflects an ontological rather than syntactic understanding of grammar. Law (1995) notes that this debate has roots in ancient philosophy: Aristotelian logic privileged predication (verbs), while Stoic theory gave priority to naming (nouns).

The mysterious term *hiboni* in the opening sentence remains textually corrupt. Manuscripts read *hi bonorum* (P) and *hiborum* (N). Huemer suggested *Hebreorum* (Hebrews), which would mean Hebrew grammar prioritizes the verb—an intriguing claim given Virgilius's frequent references to Hebrew learning. No consensus exists.

### *Res* as Hebrew Letter

The claim that *res* "is a Hebrew letter which is interpreted as 'head'" refers to the letter ר (*resh*), whose name does mean "head." Virgilius uses this to argue that *res* (thing) is etymologically a "primary" or "chief" noun.

Bischoff (1961) cites such passages as evidence for Jewish influence on Virgilius, whether through direct contact or intermediary sources. The knowledge of Hebrew letter-names was available in patristic literature (especially Jerome), but Virgilius's confident deployment suggests more than casual acquaintance.

### Naming Practices and Personal Names

The examples of name-changes—Scipio becoming *Africanus* after his victory, Gordonus becoming *Misanus* for his wealth, Mantanus becoming *Tantalicus* for his greed—mix historical and invented figures. The reference to "my uncle Samminius" (*auunculus meus*) called *Goelanus* because he was *goela* ("delightful") to his mother is one of the few personal details Virgilius provides about his family.

The term *goela* is obscure. Herren (1979) suggests connection to Irish *gol* (weeping, lamentation), which would make it an ironic nickname; alternatively, it may be invented or corrupted. Law notes that such biographical details—whether genuine or fictional—function to authenticate Virgilius's teachings through personal testimony.

### Diminutives "from Sense, not from Letter"

Virgilius's claim that Cicero analyzed words like *macula*, *tabula*, and *fibula* as "diminutives from sense, not from letter" (*ex sensu non ex littera*) reflects a semantic rather than formal approach to etymology. These words do not have obvious primitives in Latin; Virgilius (or his Cicero) argues they are nevertheless diminutive in meaning.

This principle—that morphological analysis should follow meaning rather than form—appears elsewhere in early medieval grammar. Law connects it to Irish grammatical traditions, where semantic categories sometimes override formal ones.

### The Ladder of Comparison

The image of comparison as a "ladder" (*medietas scalaris*), with positive at the bottom, comparative in the middle, and superlative at top, visualizes degree as spatial ascent. Virgilius's observation that adjectives like *praecipuus*, *egregius*, and *cernuus* are "positive in surface but superlative in quality" shows genuine grammatical insight: these forms are morphologically positive but semantically superlative.

### The Seventh Case

The discussion of a *septimus casus* (seventh case) beyond the standard six reflects real grammatical debate. The distinction Virgilius draws—ablative with preposition (*ab hac regione*) versus instrumental/locative without (*hac regione praediti*)—corresponds to genuine functional differences that some ancient grammarians recognized.

Law notes that the "seventh case" discussion appears in several late antique and early medieval grammars, reflecting awareness that Latin cases sometimes serve multiple functions. Virgilius's examples (*laude digni*, *arte macti*) show the ablative of respect/specification, which does behave differently from the ablative of separation.

### Accusative as "Active" Case

The etymology deriving *accusatiuus* from *accuso* = *ago* (to do) rather than from "accusing" is characteristic Virgilian wordplay. The citations from Cicero, Terrentius, and Gelbidius showing *accuso* meaning "to do" or "to perform" are almost certainly invented, but the underlying insight—that the accusative marks the object of action—is sound.

### Invented Defective Nouns

The nouns *pus*, *rogs*, *als*, *muls*, *glos*, and *cers*, given as examples of defective declensions, appear nowhere else in Latin literature. Löfstedt (1984) considers them pure inventions, designed to demonstrate the possibility of maximum defectiveness. Law alternatively suggests they may preserve archaic or regional forms otherwise unattested.

The invented declensions (*glos glorem o glos*; *cers cerem o cers*) show Virgilius systematically exploring logical possibilities: what would a noun with only nominative, accusative, and vocative look like?

### *Soles* as "Poems"

The claim that ancients called poems *soles* ("suns"), with a citation from "Horatius"—*soles meos omni ecclesiae uestrae commendo* ("I commend my suns to your whole church")—is puzzling. The sentence is unattested in Horace and sounds more Christian than classical (*ecclesiae uestrae*).

Löfstedt sees this as deliberate invention; Law suggests possible confusion or conflation of sources. The metaphor of poems as suns—emanating light and warmth—is poetically coherent if unprecedented. The Christian vocabulary suggests either a late source or Virgilian fabrication.

### Double Declensions and Semantic Distinctions

The elaborate distinctions between near-synonyms (*materies*/*materia*, *caluities*/*caluitia*/*caluitium*, etc.) belong to the *differentiae* tradition. Some distinctions are plausible (*temperies* for weather, *temperantia* for moral moderation); others seem invented (*origo origonis* as "ship's sail" is otherwise unattested).

The claim that *origo origonis* is neuter and means "sail" shows Virgilius's technique of generating new vocabulary by supposing alternative declension patterns. If *origo originis* is third declension and feminine, why not *origo origonis* as second declension and neuter with a different meaning?

### Word-Families as Genealogy

The comparison of derivation to human genealogy—original noun as father, verb as son, derived noun as grandson, adjective as great-grandson—provides a memorable pedagogical framework. The example *glorificatio* → *glorifico* → *gloria* → *gloriosus* traces a plausible derivational chain, though the actual Latin etymology runs differently (*gloria* is primary, not derived from a verb).

Law notes that such genealogical metaphors for linguistic relationships are common in medieval grammar, reflecting the period's interest in lineage and inheritance as organizing principles.

### The Reminiscences of Aeneas

The extended passage remembering Aeneas's teachings—"O Virgil, first the stars!"—is the most emotionally charged section of the *Epitomae*. Whether Aeneas was a real teacher or a literary fiction, these reminiscences function as wisdom literature: warnings against self-trust, exhortations to constant study, cautions against greed.

Aeneas's weary response to the question about *causa*, *res*, and *ratio*—"What does it matter, O son?"—strikes a note of scholarly exhaustion: even if correct distinctions can be made, the confusion of writers and the custom of antiquity have obscured them. This pessimism about linguistic precision contrasts with Virgilius's usual confidence, suggesting either genuine dialogue or sophisticated characterization.

Law observes that Virgilius's tears at Aeneas's "long absence" (*propter diuturnam eius absentiam*) imply death rather than mere separation. If so, the *Epitomae* may be read partly as memorial to a lost teacher—grammar as a form of mourning and commemoration.

### Unusual Case Forms

The citations from "Lucanus" and "Serenus" showing forms like *bones* (for *bonos*), *sanctem* (for *sanctum*), and *perfectem* (for *perfectum*) are otherwise unattested. These may be vulgar Latin forms that Virgilius encountered, invented examples, or deliberate demonstrations that Latin morphology could theoretically work differently.

Virgilius's defense of such forms—"teachers set them down not to harm but to benefit"—acknowledges their strangeness while asserting pedagogical value: students should be prepared to encounter unusual usages in their reading.
