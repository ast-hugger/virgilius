# II. ON THE LETTER

*[Translator's note: Latin* litera *means both "letter" (of the alphabet) and "literature/learning" more broadly. Virgilius exploits this ambiguity throughout the chapter, treating the individual letter as both the minimal unit of writing and a synecdoche for grammatical education as a whole.]*

The letter is, as it were, a kind of nativity of reading; hence I recall that my teacher Aeneas compared its stages of growth to the ages of an infant bursting forth from its mother's womb. For just as one is called an "infant" (*infans*) who does not know how to speak, and a "little one" (*paruulus*) when he strives to impress upon the ground the small efforts of his steps, and a "boy" (*puer*) when he reaches puberty, and an "adolescent" (*adulescens*) when he grows up with the stature of his body, and a "youth" (*iuuenis*) when, with adulthood reached, he becomes worthy of the arms of a spouse and of the other liberal studies, and finally a "man" (*uir*) when he attains the full power of all his senses and judgments: so too the letter, from the very characters inscribed on wax up to the composition of sentences, progresses through these same stages. For it is called "infant" when it does not sound forth with grammatical skill—those marks, at least, which serve to indicate to the little strokes being scratched onto wax tablets—and it is "little" when it advances gradually through the joining of syllables, "boyish" when it grows through the measures of metrical feet, "adolescent" when it breathes forth poetic meters through little songs of verses, "youthful" when it grasps a certain understanding of cases and verbs, and finally "mature" when it teaches most fully the composition of sentences, as I have said.

And to reveal something more intimately: the letter seems to me to be similar to the human condition. For just as a human being consists of body, soul, and a certain celestial fire, so too the letter is supported by its own body—that is, its visible shape—and by its grammatical function and signification, as if by certain joints and bonds, having its soul in meaning and its spirit in higher contemplation.

Now the number of letters is well known to all; their shape too is evident to the little ones. But concerning their power, since this has been treated for the most part, I shall explain it in Bigerran speech. Certain vowels are mobile, while others are stable; and the mobile ones sometimes appear strong, sometimes subordinate, such as *a*, *o*, *u*. For when *a* is placed at the beginning or end of any word, with *e* not immediately following, it will be strong especially when lengthened, as in *ars*, *amor*, *scola*. But when *e* follows it in the aforementioned positions, *a* will be considered weak, as in *aes*, *Aeneas*, *Micenae*, *gannae*. Likewise *o* is strong in the same positions, as in *amo*, *os*, *origo*, *sermo*; but when *e* follows, it is placed in the position of a diphthong, as in *coena*, *foedus*, *goela*. *U*, however, sometimes becomes liquid when it is subordinated by another more dominant letter, as in *uatis*, *uerax*, *uinum*, *uox*, or by itself, as in *uultus*, *inuulae*.

Furthermore, letters are strong for this reason: because they alone have force without the support of any other, such as *a*, *e*, *o*. For *a* and *e* are rightly prepositions; *o* too is sometimes an interjection, sometimes the vocative of all pronouns, and often even an active verb, albeit indeclinable. For you say *o regem decorosum* ("O the handsome king!"), and this means *miror regem decorosum* ("I marvel at the handsome king"); hence certain people are wrong to attach it to the nominative, saying *o rex decorosus*. *C* is rightly to be accepted in copulative constructions when the adverbs of negation *non* or *ne* have preceded the optative mood, and the same follows again with the addition of *nec*, from which *c*, removed, is joined to the beginning of the clause—as in *ne resedeat* ("lest he remain"), according to that passage of Galbungus where he composes a sentence about Turnus: *at uero, inquit, rex Turnus, ne populum profligaret incassum nec urbem Fidenam perderet, proeliantes pene sedauit animos* ("But truly," he says, "King Turnus, lest he scatter the people in vain and lose the city of Fidena, calmed the spirits of the combatants"). Thus it is construed: "but truly he calmed [them] lest he scatter," and by the repetition of *c*, "he calmed [them] lest he lose and lest he incline assent."

Concerning *h*, this must be said: that it always adds aspiration, sometimes for strengthening, sometimes merely for modification. For when it has preceded the semivowel *f*, they will equally modify the sound, as *hfascon*, and they make *f* in place of *hf*. But if it precedes a mute consonant *c* or *t* or *p*, it does not lose its own sound, as in *hcorda*, *htronus*, *hpalanx*. *N*, however, if *f*, *m*, *p*, or *n* follows it, will be changed into the sound of *m*, with the written form either remaining or being altered, as one pleases—as when you say *infecit*, *inflauit*, *confudit*, *inuenit*, *non ualet*, *non piget*, *inpossuit*, *non manet*.

I also want you to know this at the end of this epitome—that is, this exposition—that no letter lacks a numerical value. For *a* often signifies five hundred, sometimes thirty, sometimes ten, sometimes one. *B* signifies five thousand or merely two; *c* one hundred or eighty; *d* and *f* and *n* and *q* always produce five hundred and nine hundred; *i* and *e* produce either four hundred or only one; *m*, *r*, *s*, *u*, *l* signify one thousand; *t* and *x* signify ten and ten thousand; *g* is subject to every number up to ten; *h* from eleven up to thirty; *k* supplies one hundred times one hundred thousand; *o* is denied to no number, whether the greatest or the smallest.

## TRANSLATOR'S NOTES

### The Letter as Living Organism

The chapter's governing metaphor—the letter as a growing human being from infancy to maturity—is strikingly original. While ancient grammarians regularly distinguished levels of linguistic organization (letter, syllable, word, sentence), Virgilius's developmental framework transforms this hierarchy into a narrative of organic growth. Law (1995) notes that this biologizing of grammar reflects broader early medieval tendencies to understand texts and language as living entities requiring nurture and cultivation.

The six stages—*infans*, *paruulus*, *puer*, *adulescens*, *iuuenis*, *uir*—correspond to standard Roman age terminology, which Virgilius maps onto grammatical categories: characters → syllables → metrical feet → verses → morphology (cases and verbs) → syntax (*quassorum conpossitio*, sentence composition). This progression from physical inscription to semantic understanding implicitly values meaning over form—the letter achieves maturity only when it can teach complete thought.

### Tripartite Anthropology and Grammar

The analogy between human constitution (body, soul, celestial fire) and the letter (shape, function, spirit) extends the anthropological framework introduced in Chapter I. Here Virgilius adds *caelestis ignis* (celestial fire) as a third element beyond *plastum* and *affla*, corresponding to the letter's *spiridon* "in higher contemplation" (*superiore contemplatione*).

Herren (1979) connects this tripartite scheme to Neoplatonic and patristic models of the soul's ascent, suggesting Virgilius may have known Augustinian or Dionysian mystical traditions. The letter, like the human being, possesses not merely material existence and animate function but also a capacity for transcendence—its "contemplative" dimension pointing toward the divine *Logos* that grounds all language.

### "Bigerran Speech" (*Bigerro Sermone*)

This notorious phrase has generated considerable scholarly debate. Huemer tentatively connected it to the Bigerriones, a people of Aquitaine, suggesting Virgilius might be referring to a regional dialect or claiming Aquitanian origins. Law (1995) treats this as evidence for Virgilius's possible Gallo-Roman background, while Herren (1979) remains skeptical, seeing it as another instance of Virgilian mystification—an invented term lending false authority to his teachings.

The phrase occurs uniquely here and provides no clear interpretive key. If genuine, it might indicate that Virgilius possessed knowledge of regional Latin varieties; if invented, it exemplifies his technique of invoking obscure terminology to suggest esoteric wisdom.

### Vowel Phonology

Virgilius's discussion of "mobile" versus "stable" vowels, and "strong" versus "subordinate" (*proscriptiuae*) positions, represents a genuinely phonological analysis, however eccentric its presentation. His observations about *a* being weakened before *e* in diphthongs, and *u* becoming "liquid" in consonantal position (*uatis* = /watis/), show awareness of actual Latin phonetic processes.

Notably, Virgilius's treatment of diphthongs reflects medieval rather than classical pronunciation. In classical Latin, *ae* and *oe* were true diphthongs pronounced approximately as /ai/ and /oi/. By Virgilius's time (seventh century), these had monophthongized: *ae* had become /ɛ/ (an open *e* sound), and *oe* had merged with /e/. This explains why Virgilius treats *ae* combinations as cases where *a* is "weakened" by *e*—he is describing sequences that sounded like a simple vowel in his day, not the two-element diphthongs of Cicero's era. Similarly, when he says *oe* in words like *coena* and *foedus* is "placed in the position of a diphthong" (*diptongi loco ponetur*), he may be acknowledging an archaic spelling that no longer matched contemporary pronunciation.

This phonological evidence helps date Virgilius's milieu: his analysis presupposes the vowel changes characteristic of late and post-classical Latin. Law notes that this section, despite its peculiarities, engages with real questions in Latin phonology that concerned ancient grammarians, but filtered through the sound-system of early medieval speech.

### The Letter O as Verb

The claim that *o* functions as "an active verb, albeit indeclinable" (*uerbum actiuum licet indeclinabile*) is startling. Virgilius argues that *o regem decorosum* ("O the handsome king!") actually means *miror regem decorosum* ("I marvel at the handsome king"). This interpretation treats the vocative particle as a compressed speech act—exclamation as implicit predication.

This analysis is not entirely fanciful: modern speech-act theory would recognize that vocatives perform illocutionary functions (calling, addressing) rather than simply naming. Virgilius's intuition that *o* does something more than mark a case anticipates pragmatic approaches to interjections. Law suggests this may reflect distinctive Irish or British grammatical traditions that analyzed particles more dynamically than standard Roman grammar.

### Galbungus and King Turnus

Galbungus, one of Virgilius's most frequently cited authorities, here provides a passage about King Turnus—the antagonist of Virgil's *Aeneid*. The quotation concerns Turnus calming his combatants to avoid destroying Fidena, a scenario that does not appear in the classical epic. Löfstedt (1984) argues that Virgilius invents these passages wholesale, creating a pseudo-Virgilian literary tradition populated by fictional grammarians citing non-existent texts.

The city "Fidena" (Fidenae in classical sources) was a real place near Rome, destroyed in early Roman history. Its appearance here may reflect confused historical memory or deliberate anachronism. The elaborate grammatical analysis of *nec* and *ne* using this passage demonstrates Virgilius's technique of embedding linguistic instruction within narrative frames—however fictitious those narratives may be.

### Aspiration and Consonant Clusters

The discussion of *h* with consonants (*hf*, *hc*, *ht*, *hp*) describes phenomena unattested in classical Latin. Forms like *hfascon*, *hcorda*, *htronus*, *hpalanx* appear to be Virgilian inventions, though they may reflect attempts to represent foreign (Greek? Celtic?) sounds or spelling conventions.

Bischoff (1961) noted that some of these forms resemble transliterations of Greek aspirated consonants (φ, χ, θ), suggesting Virgilius may have been working from Greek grammatical sources or attempting to integrate Greek phonology into Latin description. Alternatively, Herren connects these forms to Irish orthographic practices, where *h* was used distinctively.

### Letter Numerology

The chapter concludes with an elaborate system of numerical values for letters that differs markedly from standard Roman numerals. While some correspondences are conventional (C = 100, M = 1000), others are not: A = 500/30/10/1; B = 5000/2; K = 10,000,000.

Law connects this to possible Hebrew influence, noting that *gematria* (letter-number equivalences) was a feature of Jewish learning that could have reached Virgilius through Iberian or Irish channels. Bischoff's hypothesis of Jewish origins for Virgilius draws partly on such passages. Herren alternatively suggests influence from ogham, the Irish alphabet, which had its own numerical associations.

The concluding statement that *o* "is denied to no number, whether the greatest or the smallest" (*nulli numero negatur siue magnissimo siue minutissimo*) gives *o* a kind of numerical omnivalence corresponding to its grammatical polyvalence earlier in the chapter—reinforcing *o*'s special status as a letter of maximal potency.

### Aeneas's Pedagogy

This chapter marks the first extended quotation of Aeneas's teaching, which Virgilius introduces with the affectionate phrase "my Aeneas" (*meum Aeneam*). The biographical detail that Virgilius "recalls" (*memini*) Aeneas comparing letters to human ages suggests either genuine reminiscence of a real teacher or careful literary construction of a pedagogical relationship.

Law (1995) argues that whether or not Aeneas existed historically, the *Epitomae* construct him as an ideal teacher whose methods—analogical, developmental, anthropomorphic—model how grammar should be taught. The letter-as-infant metaphor is precisely the kind of memorable pedagogical device that would help students internalize abstract grammatical hierarchies.
