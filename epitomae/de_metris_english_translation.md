# IV. ON METERS

The composition of meters is indeed manifold; for not all verses look to the same order, nature, number, and end. Nevertheless, every one of those who sing should know this one thing: that meters are words (*fona*) in whatever measure they may be. "Meter" (*metrum*) takes its name from "measure" (*meta*), and its feet are so called as being certain halves of words. Since these have been separated by poets out of the necessity of singing to such a degree that, with the final part of one word transferred to another, no word remains intact, for this reason no meter can be found that is plain. Many melodies of meters, however, the schools of poets and orators make known according to the will of their practitioners. For some are set forth as prose, some as lined, some also as middle-length, and not a few as quite extended; of which we shall expound a few for your benefit.

Prose verses are characterized by brevity, as is read in Aeneas:

> *Phoebus surgit, caelum scandit,*<br>
> *polo claret, cunctis paret.*

> [Phoebus rises, climbs the sky,<br>
> shines at the pole, appears to all.]

These two verses have eight meters, for the first meter is *Phoebus*, the second *surgit*, and so on through the remaining words; and thus these two together are supported by sixteen feet. All prose verses, moreover, are customarily produced in spondees. This also should be known: that among all feet, the dactyl and spondee hold the principate.

It is the nature of middle-length verses to be neither prose nor lined, which is customary more for the modulation of songs than from regard for reason, as Varro sings:

> *festa dium sollemnia*<br>
> *pupla per canam conpita,*<br>
> *quorum fistilla modela*<br>
> *poli persultant sidera.*

> [The solemn festivals of the gods,<br>
> public through the hoary crossroads,<br>
> whose little pipe-tunes<br>
> make the stars of heaven leap.]

Now measure these by meters: the first verse has three meters, of which the first is measured by a spondee and the two following by dactyls—thus *festa* (I), *dium sol-* (II), *-lemnia* (III)—and so through the four verses weighed in equal balance you will find twice six meters and thirty-two feet.

But lined verses should always be measured in five meters, according to that passage of Cato, the most elegant orator:

> *bella consurgunt poli praesentis sub fine,*<br>
> *precae temnuntur senum suetae doctrinae.*<br>
> *regis dolosi fouent dolosos tyrannos,*<br>
> *dium cultura molos neglecta per annos.*

> [Wars arise beneath the end of the present heaven,<br>
> the accustomed teachings of elders are despised as prayers.<br>
> Treacherous kings foster treacherous tyrants,<br>
> the worship of the gods neglected through many years.]

In these verses the first foot is a spondee and the third likewise a spondee; the remaining three are dactyls, which have fifty-two feet.

Extended verses, however, reach through an ornate but irrational circuit nearly up to twelve meters, according to Lupus the Christian speaking thus:

> *ueritas uera,*<br>
> *aequitas aequa,*<br>
> *largitas lauta,*<br>
> *fiditas fida*<br>
> *diurnos dies tranquilla*<br>
> *tenent tempora.*

> [True truth,<br>
> just justice,<br>
> splendid generosity,<br>
> faithful faith—<br>
> tranquil times<br>
> hold the daily days.]

For this verse, even more than usual, holds thirteen meters through a necessary addition of words, as I believe, and has thirty-three feet.

There are also those who add three-footed and four-footed verses, which indeed should not be disparaged, since a certain liberty of composing their own verses was granted to poets by our forebears. Nevertheless, undoubted trust should not be placed in these, because, supported by no authority of tuneful singers, they wished to follow permission rather than example. We shall bring forth their verses as examples.

Don, the brother of my student Donatus, composed a song of two verses in praise of Arca, king of the Arcadians, saying:

> *Archadius rex terrificus,*<br>
> *laudabilis laude dignissimus.*

> [Arcadius the terrifying king,<br>
> praiseworthy, most worthy of praise.]

And Gergesus in his commentaries, which he published in seven thick volumes on the sun, moon, stars, and especially the rainbow, very often used four-footed verses, of which I shall use just one placed at the beginning for the sake of example. For he says:

> *sol maximus mundi lucifer*<br>
> *omnia aera inlustrat pariter.*

> [The sun, greatest light-bearer of the world,<br>
> illuminates all the air equally.]

Since these arrangements of verses were set forth not for certain authority but to demonstrate the varieties of poetic songs, it is not necessary for me to investigate them, especially since anyone who wishes to weigh them can do so most easily.

Some say that in each step of two feet, the first is raised and the second lowered—or, to put it more clearly, as in *légit*, *ágit*, *míbit*, *úddit*. But we say what we feel to be correct: that we find the second feet raised no less than the first, as in *egó*, *amó*, *docé*, *audí*.

This diversity was discovered chiefly for the distinction of similar words, lest some confusion arise. For we say *sédes* in the nominative case with the first foot raised, but if it becomes a verb, we say *sedés* with the second foot raised, reversing the order. Thus when *réges* is said as a noun, the first is raised, but when it is the verb *regés*, the second foot is raised—though we are accustomed to do this not according to the rule of meters but according to the aptitude of distinction. Just as also we sharpen the first little syllable of *páne* in the imperative mood and press down the last. And conversely, when it becomes an adverb or preposition, the first is pressed down and the last is sharpened.

Just as also certain kinds of songs, which although they seem extraordinary, are nevertheless always employed by orators and wit-masters (*leporici*) according to the enticement of pleasures—such are *cantamenta* and *cantatellae*, which Sagillius the German and Vitellius especially use. And the former indeed, in a little book written about the sea and moon, immediately inserted a *cantamentum* in the proem, saying:

> *mare et luna concurrunt una*<br>
> *uice altante temporum gande.*

> [Sea and moon run together as one,<br>
> alternating in the course of the seasons.]

The latter, however, in praise of Matrona his wife, introduced a rather charming *cantatella*, beginning thus in a certain work:

> *mea, mea Matrona, tuum amplector soma,*<br>
> *nobis anima una heret aquae arctura.*

> [My own, my Matrona, I embrace your body,<br>
> one soul clings to us like water's constraint.]

And since a little mention has been made of orators and wit-masters, and the discourse has progressed to meters and songs, it seems fitting to me that I should at some point make mention of the kinds of philosophy. Philosophy is the love and pursuit of wisdom, which is the fount and mother of every art and discipline; hence anyone who pursues wisdom with pure love and intent care in any part, whether celestial or terrestrial, is rightly to be called a philosopher. The arts of our philosophy are many, and their principal studies are: poetry, rhetoric, grammar, *leporia*, dialectic, geometry, and so forth, which aim not so much at emulation as at curiosity.

Between poetry and rhetoric there is this difference: that poetry, content with its own variety, is narrow and obscure; rhetoric, however, rejoicing in its own pleasantness, sets forth breadth and beauty with a certain magnificent enumeration of meters, feet, accents, tones, and syllables.

But many in this time, ignorant of the force and defensibility of these arts, heap poetry into rhetoric and rhetoric into poetry, not keeping in memory what Felix, the teacher of the Alexanders, commanded: "Let each art," he said, "be contained within its own boundaries, lest the discipline of the elders be adulterated and we be forced to accuse them." Very often I am compelled to remember my customary verse, which I frequently sing out in reproach of the boors of our time: *mulctaui tornores logii nec arenam cessi* ["I have scourged the turners of speech, nor have I yielded the arena"].

And truly, who will enter the inner veins of wisdom? Who will spend every night-watch, every care, every day, every night upon wisdom? For many who begin to pursue wisdom from boyhood are swiftly carried off to worldly business, having abandoned legitimate studies, struck as if by a sudden blow. Hence our teachers have also determined that none of those who are bound by worldly pleasure and desire for money can reach the true knowledge of wisdom.

But to return to what I began: *leporia* is a certain rich art, displaying pleasantness and sharpness on its face, yet not avoiding mendacity in its interior; for it does not fear to exceed the boundaries of the elders, and is confounded by no reproach. Concerning which I do not hesitate to bring forth a few examples.

Lapidus indeed, present in the lesser Asia as an orator, wrote many things worthy of reproach, such as that saying: *sol in occursu metitur maria* ["The sun in its setting measures the seas"]. There is no truth here, for it is possible for no created nature to measure the depths of the sea. Therefore we say: *sol in occursu tinguit mare* ["The sun in its setting tinges the sea"], and having thus transiently tinged it in a certain way, hastening to those in the west, it shines for them most ardently all night long. Lapidus likewise says: *uentus acer roborum radices euellit altas* ["The sharp wind tears up the deep roots of oaks"]—which cannot happen at all; rather, the wind only shakes the oaks.

Grammar is the careful observation of literature, which is as it were a certain little pathway of all reading; hence the learned also interpret "letter" (*litera*) as "leg-way" (*legitera*), which is the itinerary of reading, whose usefulness I praise above all others, and which nearly the whole world shares.

Dialectic is the biter of all words which are customarily read, spoken, and written by all people, in a certain way disemboweling and shredding the entrails of sentences, the marrows of meanings, the veins of words. Its practitioners caw in every picture and with gaping maw eagerly seek the reproach of all writers. One of these was Julianus, father of Donatus and Don, who used to tell us that *dici non debet* ["it ought not be said"] and *dici non oportet* ["it is not fitting to say"] are very different things. For *oportet* ("it is fitting") is derived from "opportunity," but *debet* ("ought") from "insoluble debt." Hence if you say *non oportet*, you do not so much forbid it entirely as show that it is not opportune; but when you say *non debet*, it is a debt, if it ever be done.

They also say that *non potest fieri* ["it cannot be done"] and *inpossibile fieri* ["it is impossible to be done"] are different things. For what "cannot" presently cannot, and perhaps sometime it may be able; but what is "impossible," as if spoken definitively, will in no way be able to be accomplished. And they say this too: that *locutus est* ["he spoke"] and *dixit mihi* ["he said to me"] are different. For *loqui* ("to speak") is a mark of more elaborate eloquence, while *dicere* ("to say") is simply and commonly referred to any utterance. They also say that *uolo* ["I wish"] and *cupio* ["I desire"] are different: for "wishing" is understood from a certain sweet and legitimate will, but "desiring" belongs to immoderate cupidity.

They affirm that there is no small difference between *bellum* (war), *praelium* (sea-battle), *pugna* (fight), and *certamen* (contest). For a *praelium* can only take place in a *praelium*—that is, in the sea (*pelagus*)—which is therefore called *praelium* because, surpassing other elements in a certain immensity of itself, flooding and unflooding, it has a certain preeminence of wonder. But *bellum* is waged only in *belsa*—that is, in a field. For *belsa* is so called because it brings forth very many *belsa*, which are grasses. *Certamen*, however, is derived from a "certain place" (*certus locus*)—that is, a receptacle of the army. A *pugna* is where combatants (*pugilles*) on both sides hurl their daggers (*pugiones*).

They also say that *plebs* and *populus* are different: for *plebs* is that multitude which, abounding in full fields and houses with every substance, is therefore neither vigorous in war nor effective in learning; but *populus* is so called from *pope*—that is, from strength, whether of hands or senses. Hence we reproach the grammarian Honoratus, who sings: *plebs in bello congregata est* ["The plebs was gathered in war"]. And in another place: *uerus poeta sic ait* ["The true poet thus speaks"], he says. How stupidly he has spoken, when he should have said *uerax poeta* ["the truthful poet"]. For *uerus* refers only to the truth of nature, but *uerax* is said of one who in no way lies.

Nor do many rightly accept *consummotio* in a good sense and *consummatio* in a bad sense, when *consummotio* pertains to failure and *consummatio* to perfection. Badly do some wish *loquelae* to be understood in the sense of "eloquence," when *loquelae* are diminutives, as if simple *clefia*. *Loquelae*, to be written with *e* and one *l*, pertain to perfect eloquence. I also wonder why some of our own, and indeed wise ones, have put "creatures" (*creaturas*) for "elements" (*elimenta*) and "elements" for "creatures," when "element" should be called nothing but something ethereal, as if divine. For *hele* among the Hebrews is "god," whence also among the Greeks *helium* is called "sun." But "creature" is called whatever has been created from earthly matter. There are also elements—that is, beginnings—of literature, which are so called from "elimination"—that is, from inscription.

Let these things be said concerning the art of dialectic, which some have called "sophistic"—that is, sharp—or from *sapidium*, "sapid." Now let us come to geometry.

Geometry is a disciplined art which declares the knowledge of all herbs and grasses; hence we also call doctors who rely on this art *geometres*—that is, experts in herbs.

There is also another art of philosophy, which is called astronomy, which the Greeks call *mathesis*, which shows the courses and lines of all the stars. In this art the signs of seasons and the opportunities of works are understood. From it twelve principal signs are calculated, which the Greeks call *mazaron*, among whom, however, not twelve signs but sixteen are held, whose names are *mon*, *mah*, *tonte*, *piron* or *dameth*, *perfellea*, *belgalic*, *margaleth*, *lutamiron*, *tamimon*, *raphalut*, and so forth—by which they think all the law of the human race is governed. Just as Aemerius used to say about a certain foolish woman: "She suffers this because on the first night on which she was married, *mon* and *belgalic* ran together."

But since no reason permits us to believe that a star was made from itself, it is right for no sensible man to believe that the laws and customs of human status are governed by the stars, but rather by that immense power from which even the stars were made, and by which both the times and works of all people are ruled—which power we often see called "divinity" and therefore "God" by the men and women of that worship, and invoked.

All human industry, therefore, all wisdom looks to this: that it may ascend from lower things to higher, so that, discussing the natural knowledge of all things—that is, *physica*—and legitimately transcending *ethica*, which extends to the improvements of morals, it may reach *logica* itself—that is, the rational disputation of heavenly things.

This also should be known and examined by every wise person: how and in what manner the embodied human being is constituted, who has first a body (*plastum*) from clay, then a soul (*affla*) from above, and these ineffably conjoined, enjoying a dissimilar nature in himself. The body indeed, compacted as if from baser material—namely, connected from liquid and dry, cold and hot things—let him know to be assigned to the service of the soul, which is the *anima*. But since the soul commands the body only to this end, that it may animate it just as all living creatures, therefore unless this soul has mind (*mens*) and reason (*ratio*), it differs in nothing from the animals, which lack both. As the soul presides over the body, so the mind presides over the soul and reason over the mind. "Mind" (*mens*) is said from "measuring" (*metiendo*), since it opens the measure of subtler senses to the soul, in which capacity, thus made, the higher reason poured in makes it perfectly wise in all things.

According to the threefold rule of wisdom, therefore, which we mentioned, there is also a threefold state in the human being. The soul (*anima*) indeed perceives natural things, in which is also natural ability (*ingenium*), inserted and named for itself from the nobility of creation by the Creator. The mind (*mens*), however, understands moral things, in which is memory, by which it tenaciously remembers things seen or heard, and gathering them in the mind as in a certain whole vessel, it teems with innumerable thoughts. Reason (*ratio*), however, surveying higher and celestial things, possesses an understanding somehow fiery and flaming.

Not undeservedly, therefore, did our teachers, and especially Sulpita and Istrius, deem the human being by the name of "lesser world" (*mundus minor*), since he has in himself all things from which the visible world consists. For earth is understood in the body and fire in the soul, water in rigidity and air in the swiftness of thoughts, the sun in the splendor of wisdom, the moon in the uncertain and unstable state of riches and youth, a flowering field in the nobility of virtues and the plain of gentleness, mountains in the exultation of nobility, hills in the succession of inheritance, valleys in the humiliation of tribulation, fruitful trees in the fruits of generosity, barren trees and rough places and foul chasms and also thorns and thistles in evil habits and greedy maws, serpents and cattle in simplicity and prudence, and also the wavy, beast-filled sea in the turbulent depth of the human heart and in reason itself.

Having run through all these things, though by another route, let us return to our purpose—that is, to the preparation of meters, as far as the end. Every verse of six or seven measures is rhetorical; but the trimeter, tetrameter, and pentameter is poetic. Concerning Sapphic and heroic verse-meter, I recall having written sufficiently in a certain letter which I sent to Donatus at Rome among twelve. I fear, therefore, that if I repeat these same things, I may begin to be considered a tedious writer rather than a careful teacher.

Concerning Greek meters, however, whose nature is dissimilar and far different, I think it unnecessary to discuss anything here, since I am producing a Latin work. But above all, these three things are necessary for every teacher wishing to compose songs: first, that having knowledge of the letters to be written, he depict the modes and measures of each letter and syllable, and not mix verse with verse or meter with meter, lest his own or his students' art, though well composed, confer no profit on readers through ignorance of writing. Then, that he not be deceived in the parts of speech and in Roman truth, lest what he thought he had composed eloquently, through ignorance of Latin truth, acquire laughter instead of praise. Third, that in his songs he render each verse to its own right, lest, as King Alexander of Macedon boldly reproached a certain person singing praises to him, he be by his own fault a darkener of precious pearls.

## TRANSLATOR'S NOTES

### The Chapter's Encyclopedic Scope

Law (1995) observes that *De Metris* functions less as a treatise on prosody than as an introduction to the full range of philosophical learning. The chapter's digressions—from metrics to philosophy to astronomy to anthropology—reflect the medieval understanding of grammar as the foundation of all knowledge. Irvine (1994) argues that for early medieval thinkers, *grammatica* was not merely a technical discipline but the gateway to *sapientia*, encompassing what we would now separate as linguistics, literary criticism, philosophy, and natural science.

The return to metrics at the chapter's end ("Having run through all these things, though by another route, let us return to our purpose") acknowledges the apparent disorder while framing the digressions as necessary background. This encyclopedic approach resembles Isidore of Seville's *Etymologies*, suggesting Virgilius participated in the early medieval project of comprehensive learning organized around linguistic categories.

### Virgilius's Metrical System

The fourfold classification of verse—*prosa* (prose/short), *liniata* (lined), *mederia* (middle-length), and *perextensi* (extended)—does not correspond to any classical system. Löfstedt (1984) suggests Virgilius may be inventing categories to appear systematic, while Law argues these may reflect actual practices in insular Latin poetry, where verse forms differed from continental norms.

The verse examples attributed to Aeneas, Varro, Cato, and Lupus Christianus are almost certainly Virgilian compositions or inventions. Their content—cosmic phenomena, divine worship, abstract virtues—suggests liturgical or hymnic models. Herren (1979) connects these verses to the *hisperica famina* tradition, noting shared vocabulary and rhythmic patterns.

### Accent and Stress

Virgilius's discussion of word-stress (*légit* vs. *legít*, *sédes* vs. *sedés*) engages genuine phonological phenomena. Classical Latin was quantity-based (long vs. short syllables), but by Virgilius's time, stress accent was becoming the primary prosodic feature. His observation that accent distinguishes noun from verb (*sédes* "seat" vs. *sedés* "you sit") reflects actual linguistic change.

Law notes that this passage provides valuable evidence for seventh-century Latin pronunciation, suggesting that Virgilius, despite his eccentricities, preserved genuine linguistic knowledge. The examples may document stress patterns in Vulgar Latin or regional varieties.

### *Cantamenta* and *Cantatellae*

These diminutive terms for song types (*cantamentum*, *cantatella*) are unattested elsewhere and may be Virgilian coinages. Their attribution to "Sagillius the German" (*Sagillius germanus*) and Vitellius is intriguing: *Sagillius* suggests a Germanic name, possibly indicating contact with Frankish or Gothic Latin traditions.

The love poem to Matrona attributed to Vitellius—"My own, my Matrona, I embrace your *soma*"—uses the Greek word σῶμα (body), characteristic of the learned code-switching found in *hisperica famina*. Law suggests such verses may represent actual insular compositions, embedded in Virgilius's text as examples of contemporary practice.

### The Assault on *Leporia*

Virgilius's extended critique of *leporia* (wit, cleverness) as an art that "does not avoid mendacity in its interior" is striking. The examples from Lapidus—claiming the sun "measures" the sea or that wind "uproots" oaks—are attacked not for stylistic faults but for factual falsehood.

This concern with truth-value distinguishes Virgilius from purely formalist grammarians. Law interprets this passage as evidence of a "scientific" or "naturalist" strain in Virgilian thought: rhetorical claims must correspond to natural possibility. The alternative formulations Virgilius offers (*tinguit* for *metitur*, *labefactat* for *euellit*) prioritize accuracy over effect.

### The Dialectical Distinctions

The series of paired terms (*debet* vs. *oportet*, *uerus* vs. *uerax*, *bellum* vs. *praelium*, etc.) belongs to the *differentiae* tradition—lists of near-synonyms with distinct meanings. Such lists appear in Isidore and other grammarians, serving both pedagogical and philosophical purposes.

Virgilius's etymologies are characteristically inventive. Deriving *praelium* (battle) from *pelagus* (sea) because naval battles occur on water, and *bellum* from *belsa* (grasses, because land battles occur in fields), inverts normal etymological reasoning: instead of words revealing realities, realities are made to fit words.

The criticism of Honoratus for writing *plebs in bello* and *uerus poeta* illustrates Virgilius's prescriptivism. Löfstedt notes that these "errors" would be unremarkable in classical Latin; Virgilius's objections seem designed to demonstrate dialectical subtlety rather than correct genuine mistakes.

### Hebrew Etymology and the Name of God

The derivation of *elementum* from Hebrew *hele* (allegedly "god") and Greek *helium* (sun) reflects the syncretistic etymology common in early medieval learning. The claim that *hele* means "god" in Hebrew is roughly correct—אֵל (*El*) is a divine name—though Virgilius's phonetic reasoning is fanciful.

Bischoff (1961) cites such passages as evidence for Jewish influence on Virgilius, whether through direct contact or intermediary sources. Law more cautiously notes that Hebrew etymologies circulated widely in patristic literature, making direct Jewish contact unnecessary to explain Virgilius's knowledge.

### Geometry as Herbalism

Virgilius's definition of *geometria* as "the knowledge of all herbs and grasses" reverses the standard meaning (earth-measurement, mathematics). This may be playful etymology (*geo-* = earth, therefore earthly plants) or may reflect a genuine alternative tradition in which *geometres* meant something like "naturalist."

Herren connects this to Irish learning, where the boundaries between disciplines were drawn differently than in Mediterranean traditions. The *Hisperica Famina* similarly treats botanical knowledge as part of comprehensive learning.

### The Sixteen-Sign Zodiac

Virgilius's claim that the Greeks have sixteen zodiacal signs (not twelve) with names like *mon*, *mah*, *belgalic*, etc., has puzzled scholars. The standard zodiac has twelve signs with Greek and Latin names; Virgilius's list corresponds to nothing known.

Law suggests these may be corrupted Hebrew or Aramaic terms—several (*margaleth*, *dameth*) resemble Semitic words—possibly reflecting contact with Jewish astronomical traditions. Alternatively, Virgilius may be inventing a system to suggest esoteric knowledge beyond ordinary learning.

The rejection of astrological determinism that follows ("no sensible man should believe that laws and customs are governed by stars") is thoroughly Christian and may represent Virgilius's own theological position emerging from his invented framework.

### The Threefold Soul and the Microcosm

The anthropology presented here—*anima* (soul/natural perception), *mens* (mind/moral understanding), *ratio* (reason/celestial knowledge)—elaborates the simpler body/soul distinction in *De Sapientia*. This tripartite psychology corresponds to the three branches of philosophy (*physica*, *ethica*, *logica*) and implies an ascending hierarchy from earthly to heavenly knowledge.

The microcosm doctrine (humans as *mundus minor* containing all cosmic elements) derives ultimately from Platonic and Stoic sources but reached the early Middle Ages through patristic intermediaries. Its attribution to "Sulpita and Istrius" (otherwise unknown authorities) gives the doctrine Virgilian credentials while obscuring its actual sources.

The elaborate correspondences—sun/wisdom, moon/unstable fortune, mountains/nobility, thorns/evil habits—combine cosmological, moral, and psychological categories in ways characteristic of early medieval symbolic thought. Law notes that such systems could function as mnemonic devices, allowing students to internalize complex ideas through memorable images.

### Cross-Reference to the *Epistolae*

The mention of "a certain letter which I sent to Donatus at Rome among twelve" referring to Sapphic and heroic meters explicitly connects the *Epitomae* to the *Epistolae*, Virgilius's other surviving work. This cross-reference suggests the two works were conceived as a unified curriculum, with the *Epistolae* providing more advanced treatment of topics introduced in the *Epitomae*.

### Alexander of Macedon

The concluding warning—that bad poetry makes its author "a darkener of precious pearls," as Alexander told a would-be panegyrist—invokes classical authority for standards of excellence. The anecdote, though unattested in Alexander literature, resembles stories about Alexander's contempt for flattery found in Plutarch and other sources.

The image of "darkening pearls" (*fuscator margaritarum*) suggests that bad craftsmanship corrupts inherently valuable material—language itself being the "pearls" that incompetent poets tarnish. This aesthetic position values linguistic material as precious in itself, damaged by unskillful handling.
