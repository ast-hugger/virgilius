### XIV. ON THE COGNOMINATIONS OF NOUNS AND VERBS

---

I remember that I was asked last year by Donatus, my student and your fellow citizen, to reveal whence *caelum* (sky/heaven) is said. To him I replied that it had not been in my mind to expend that work at that time. I was not able to devote time to the body of nouns at that hurried time; now I shall bestow it upon your affection, about to add other things as well.

*Caelum* is thought to be so called because it conceals certain great mysteries within itself, and because it is hidden from humans by the spaces of the air and the obstacles of clouds; from its hiddenness it most rightly receives its name. We have said "high heaven"; but altitude sometimes signifies depth as well: indeed, whether the sea or whatever is placed beneath the earth is to be called *altum* (high/deep). As also the old man Donatus says: *te precor o tu in imis quicumque es emitte mihi solem mox terris inlaturum lumen* ("I beseech you, O you in the depths whoever you are, send forth to me the sun about to bring light to shine on the earth forthwith").

*Terra* (earth) is so called because it is trodden by the feet of humans. But otherwise, therefore, it is called *ra*: first because we are born from it—whence also from *humus* (soil) *homo* (human) is said—according to which we are nourished and refreshed by its fruits. Third, because when released in death we are hidden back into it as into a mother's womb.

*Mare* (sea) is said from *amaritudo* (bitterness); by the Hebrews it is called "the collection of waters." *Sol* (sun) is so called because alone through the day by the force of its brilliance it illuminates the whole world, with the stars and moon together dimmed; or certainly *sol* is named from *sollemnitas*, that is, the abundance of splendor. *Luna* (moon) is thought to be named from a certain Diana, who was called a deity; but what is truer, *luna* is called from light itself.

*Stella* (star) was called from a certain Stillinus, whom they say was the charioteer of the stars; but all stars are so to be called because, like certain drippings, they run about with light flight. But between *stellae* and *astra* and *sidera*—which are the three kinds of heavenly ornament—what is the difference? That *stellae*, as we have said, are derived from "dripping." *Astra* from the variety of painting (for *aster* among philosophers means "painter"); *sidus* is named from a greater position. Therefore *sidera* are the highest of the heavenly bodies, *stellae* are whatever smallest and lightest bodies, but *astra* are all the ornament of the heavens.

*Auis* (bird) is to be said from the eagerness of seizing; *uolucer* (winged creature) indeed from the very velocity of flying; *uolatile* (flying thing), however, will not be a noun of proximate position but a derived one. Whatever flies is commonly so called, as Cato says: *sagittae illius uolatiles sunt* ("His arrows are *uolatiles*"). And Cicero: *elifantui inquit uolatiles in bello* ("Elephants," he says, "are *uolatiles* in war"). *Bestia* (beast) is said from *bessus*, that is, from the manner of wildness. *Belba* will be a sea creature, for *bel* is called "sea" by the natural philosophers.

*Caro* (flesh) is said from the dearness of acquaintance; *corpus* (body) from the corruptibility of nature—but this is concerning a human being. Otherwise, what lies open to sight is called *corpus*. It is asked whence it is so called: *pus* in philosophy means "custody," as Origenes says: *positis in pure fratribus solus euasit* ("With his brothers placed in *pure*, he alone escaped")—that is, in prison. *Corpora*, if it is called custody. *Caput* (head) is said to be taken from *capitas*, whence *capere* (to take) is said of what we eat and *tenere* (to hold) of what we touch with the hand; but it is referred to the soul, in that it is capable of thoughts and memory.

*Oculus* (eye) is so called because it sees through and surveys hidden things. *Auris* (ear) because it draws in the hearing of speech from within. *Pectus* (chest) is said from the fact that it looks toward the secrets of the heart, from *pectando*, that is, discerning—whence *peccata* (sins) are so called. *Ubera* (breasts) are said only of women, which are named from the abundance of milk; if anyone should wish to name them in men, they will be *uirilia*, which overflow with an inundation of humors. *Uenter* (belly) is so called from the breath of wind; for *uentus* (wind) also receives its name for this reason: that it reaches through all the veins, hiding places, and joints of the whole creature. *Lingua* (tongue) is said from licking.

The philosophers called virtue and running "hands" and "feet," whose nouns have monoptote declension through all genders. From *man*, therefore—that is, virtue—*manus* (hands) are so called, and from *per*, *pedes* (feet), which is from running. *Equus* (horse) is said from the equity of its gait. *Uir* (man) is named from *uirtus* (virtue); *mulier* (woman) from the softness of her sex; *uxor* (wife) who had been "wived" by a man in union. But *coitus* (coming together) is generally said of all coming together, whether of journey or of concord or of marriages. *Cor* (heart) is called from the corruption of the senses.

*Lux* (light) is always said of the heavenly, that is, of day and sun; but *lumen* (lamp-light) is material, that is, of fire or a lamp. *Aqua* (water) is generally said of all liquid. *Panis* (bread) is said of everything that feeds. *Uinus* (wine) either from *uinea* (vine) or because it fills the veins. *Labia* (lips) are said from the labor of speaking, or because they slip through words, from *lapsus* (slipping).

*Lapides* (stones) are said from their lamp-quality, because from them lamps of fire are kindled. Precious stones are named from the splendor implanted in them, as from a certain likeness of lamps. But *saxa* (rocks), however, immense and immobile, are said to be like certain statues. *Petra* (rock) is said from hardness.

*Dies* (day) is named by some because it is pleasing to the gods; we say *dies* because it divides from darkness. *Nox* (night) is said from the fact that it harms humans. *Tempus* (time) is said from temperament, because it is tempered by days, months, years, cold, and summer. *Annus* (year) is so called because it renews all things. *Mensis* (month) is said from *mensura* (measure), or because it fills the table—that is, the earth—with its fruits and feasts.

*Aestus* (summer heat) is said from the length of days; it is also called *ardon*. *Autumnus* (autumn) is said from the augmentation of fruits, because they are gathered. *Hiemps* (winter) is interpreted as cold or sterility. *Uer* (spring)—this is because in it all things grow green, that is, become verdant. *Pluuia* (rain) because it rains from the sky, or because it irrigates the growth of the earth itself. *Nubes* (clouds) are so called because they cover the sun with their covering as if under a certain cloak.

*Gloria* (glory) from glorification; among philosophers, *glores* is what they are called. *Gratia* (grace) is that which is given freely or received without price. *Brachium* (arm) means strength. We say *dentes* (teeth) because they give speech or strength to the voice; others have named them *ruminae*, others *mandibulae*, because they gnaw or chew food.

The nature of each thing is that in which it is born and without which it cannot live—just as a human without action, a bird without flight, a fish without swimming. And just as the body consists of five senses, so writing consists of five vowel letters, which reign in the eight parts of speech.

## TRANSLATOR'S NOTES

### The Occasional Frame

The chapter opens with a personal narrative: Donatus, described as "my student and your fellow citizen" (*meo discente, uestro municipe*), asked Virgilius the previous year about the etymology of *caelum*. Virgilius was too busy at the time but now fulfills the request, promising to "add other things as well."

This dedicatory frame—responding to a student's question—places the etymological material within a pedagogical relationship. Law (1995) notes that such occasional framing is characteristic of medieval educational texts, situating abstract learning within personal exchange.

### The Multiplication of Donati

The chapter mentions both a student Donatus and a *senex Donatus* (old man Donatus) who is quoted praying to chthonic powers to release the sun. This "old Donatus" may be the legendary figure from Chapter XV (Donatus of Troy), the famous fourth-century grammarian Aelius Donatus recast, or another invention entirely.

Löfstedt (1984) observes that Virgilius populates his world with multiple figures sharing names—several Virgils, several Donati—creating a sense of continuous grammatical tradition while obscuring actual historical relationships.

### *Caelum* and Mystical Concealment

The etymology deriving *caelum* from *celare* (to conceal) because heaven "conceals great mysteries within itself" (*grandia celat archana*) connects cosmology to esoteric knowledge. Heaven is not merely distant but deliberately veiled—a vault hiding divine secrets.

This resonates with the chapter on *scinderatio*, where grammatical knowledge itself is concealed "lest pigs trample gems." Law connects such passages to a consistent Virgilian theme: true wisdom is hidden and requires initiation to access.

### *Terra* as Threefold Mother

The analysis of *terra* through a threefold relationship—we are born from earth, nourished by it, and buried in it "as into a mother's womb" (*uelut in matris uuluam*)—combines classical ideas of *Tellus Mater* with Christian burial theology. The earth receives the dead maternally, not merely as grave but as womb.

The phrase "released in death" (*laeto soluti*) may be corrupt (*laeto* for *leto*, "death"), but the maternal imagery is clear. Herren (1979) notes similar earth-mother themes in Irish religious poetry of the period.

### Hebrew and Patristic Sources

The reference to the Hebrews calling the sea "the collection of waters" (*ab Hebreis aquarum collectus*) echoes Genesis 1:10, where God names the gathered waters "seas." This is one of several passages suggesting Virgilius's awareness of biblical tradition, whether through direct reading or patristic intermediaries.

The citation of Origenes (Origen) on *pus* meaning "custody"—"with his brothers placed in *pure*, he alone escaped, that is, in prison"—apparently references Joseph's imprisonment in Egypt. Whether Virgilius had access to Origen's works directly or knew this citation second-hand is unclear. Law cautions that Virgilius's learned references often cannot be verified and may be inventions or garbled traditions.

### The Threefold Celestial Hierarchy

The distinction between *stellae*, *astra*, and *sidera*—"the three kinds of heavenly ornament" (*tria genera caelestis ornatus*)—creates a celestial hierarchy:

- **Sidera**: The highest, from *situs maior* (greater position)
- **Astra**: All heavenly ornament, from *aster* (painter)—stars as divine artwork
- **Stellae**: The smallest and lightest, from *stillare* (dripping)—stars as light-drops

This tripartite scheme may reflect astronomical, astrological, or angelological traditions about celestial ranks. The charioteer "Stillinus" who drives the stars is otherwise unattested and likely invented.

### *Aster* as "Painter"

The claim that "among philosophers, *aster* means painter" (*aster quippe apud philosophos pictor dicitur*) is philologically false—Greek ἀστήρ simply means "star"—but allows Virgilius to derive *astra* from "the variety of painting" (*picturae uarietas*). Stars become divine artwork decorating the heavens.

This creative etymology transforms astronomy into aesthetics: the night sky as painted canvas. Smyth (1989) connects such imagery to early medieval Irish texts celebrating cosmic beauty as evidence of divine artistry.

### Elephants as *Volatiles*

The quotation attributed to Cicero—"Elephants are *uolatiles* in war" (*elifantui uolatiles in bello*)—is bizarre, since *uolatilis* normally means "flying" or "winged." Either Virgilius has a lost or corrupt text, this is invention, or *uolatile* here means something like "charging" or "impetuous."

Law suggests the passage may satirize overly creative etymology, or may preserve an otherwise lost figurative usage. The citation from Cato about "volatile arrows" makes conventional sense; the elephants remain puzzling.

### *Peccata* from *Pectus*

The derivation of *peccata* (sins) from *pectando* (discerning, combing through)—itself connected to *pectus* (chest)—creates a moral etymology: sins are what the chest/heart "combs through" or fails to discern properly. This connects the physical organ of conscience to moral discernment and its failure.

Fontaine (1959) notes similar moralized body-part etymologies in Isidore of Seville, suggesting a shared late antique tradition of reading the body as moral map.

### Philosophical Monoptota: *Man* and *Per*

The claim that philosophers called virtue and running "hands" and "feet" respectively—deriving *manus* from *man* (virtue) and *pedes* from *per* (running)—with "monoptote declension through all genders" is characteristically Virgilian. Monoptota are indeclinable nouns; Virgilius imagines a philosophical language where abstract concepts underlie bodily terms.

This reverses normal etymology: instead of abstract concepts derived from concrete experience, the body itself derives from philosophical abstractions. Law interprets such passages as playful exploration of the arbitrary relationship between words and things.

### *Bel* as "Sea"

The claim that *bel* means "sea" among "natural philosophers" (*a fisicis*), making *belba* a sea creature, may reflect awareness of Semitic languages—Babylonian cosmogonic texts feature primordial waters—or may be pure invention. The word *belba* is otherwise unattested.

Bischoff (1961) connects such pseudo-Semitic etymologies to possible Jewish influence on Virgilius's learning, though Law cautions that such material circulated widely in patristic sources.

### *Cor* from Corruption

The etymology deriving *cor* (heart) from "corruption of the senses" (*corruptio sensuum*) is striking. Rather than the heart as seat of virtue or feeling, Virgilius presents it as the site where sensory experience goes wrong.

This pessimistic anthropology—the heart as corruptor rather than guide—may reflect Augustinian views of fallen human nature, where even the innermost self is compromised by sin.

### Nature as Essential Activity

The philosophical observation that "the nature of each thing is that in which it is born and without which it cannot live—just as a human without action, a bird without flight, a fish without swimming" reflects Aristotelian principles in simplified form.

The examples are traditional (birds fly, fish swim), but the definition of humans by "action" (*actus*) rather than reason is notable. This may reflect monastic emphasis on active life (*vita activa*), the practical character of early medieval education, or simply loose formulation. The absence of *ratio* as human defining trait is nonetheless striking.

### The Cosmic Analogy

The chapter's conclusion offers a grand analogy: "Just as the body consists of five senses, so writing consists of five vowel letters, which reign in the eight parts of speech."

This microcosm-macrocosm thinking—body : senses :: writing : vowels—reflects medieval ideas about correspondence between human constitution and linguistic structure. The verb "reign" (*regnant*) presents grammar as a kingdom with vowels as sovereigns, consonants and parts of speech as subjects.

Law notes that such analogies pervade medieval grammatical thinking, treating language not as arbitrary convention but as reflecting cosmic order. The five vowels correspond to five senses, suggesting that grammar participates in the same numerical harmonies that structure creation.

### The Milan Fragment

Huemer's apparatus notes that a *Fragmentum Mediolanense* (Milan fragment) preserves a parallel version of much of this chapter with variations. The fragment explains *terra* differently, connecting *ra* to "carrier" (*portatrix*) like *genetrix*, and adds material about ships called *rares* because they carry, and about *brachium* meaning "fortitude" in philosophical Latin.

These fragments suggest that Virgilius's etymological teaching circulated in various forms and was excerpted for educational use, demonstrating ongoing medieval interest in his material despite (or because of) its eccentricities.

### Comparison with Isidore

Many of Virgilius's etymologies parallel those in Isidore of Seville's *Etymologiae*, composed roughly contemporaneously:

- *Homo* from *humus*: shared (ultimately biblical)
- *Luna* from *lumen*: shared
- *Nox* from *nocere*: shared
- *Annus* from renewal: shared

But Virgilius's versions often add invented authorities, philosophical speculation, or mystical interpretation absent from Isidore's more encyclopedic approach. Whether Virgilius knew Isidore, Isidore knew Virgilius, or both drew on common sources remains debated. Law inclines toward independent development from shared late antique traditions.
