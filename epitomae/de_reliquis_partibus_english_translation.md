### VIII. ON THE REMAINING PARTS OF SPEECH

---

With the edict concerning the principal parts having been treated as briefly as possible, separately through the individual parts—that is, concerning the noun, pronoun, and verb—now through the remaining parts of speech we are about to set forth, as if through a chronicle, one epitome only.

#### (8.) On the Adverb

The adverb is, as it were, an oblique servant to the verb, whose species is nevertheless multiform. For some designate place, some time. When you say *tum*, it signifies time, but when you say *tun*, it shows place, as Cato says: *utrique in Taurum coetus condixere montem, tun pugnauere totum collecti per diem* ("Both assemblies agreed upon Mount Taurus, *tun* they fought, gathered together through the whole day"). So also *con* is an adverb for *illuc* (thither), as Marcellus writes: *ite con arma ponite aerea secrete castris* ("Go *con*, lay down your bronze arms, secretly from the camps"). And these two joined together, *tuncon*, make an adverb of likeness for *tanquam* (as if), according to that saying of Lucanus: *et populus tuncon mare fluctuans consternari fecit terram* ("And the people *tuncon* the fluctuating sea caused the land to be terrified"). *Tanquam*: thus it ought to be said, as we explained above in the section on pronouns, lest two words be thought to exist at once by the unskilled.

Every adverb which is born from a noun, the ancients in the composition of cases used to join to nouns, as Glengus used to say: *uir in acie fortiter pro domo liberis et capite pugnat* ("A man in battle bravely fights for home, children, and life")—not, however, "bravely fights," but "man bravely." There are adverbs which are thought to be neuter nouns but are not, such as *longe*, *prope*, *necesse*, *facile*, *deficile*; but nevertheless, because *facilis* and *deficilis* are found very often, it would not be surprising if *facile* and *deficile* were also found as neuters—except that Aeneas denied this could happen. These adverbs are strong, which cooperate with a neuter verb so that it may act, if however they are taken from the infinitive mood—as if you should say: *longe est nos in his ulterius commorari locis* ("It is far for us to remain longer in these places"). Whence Aeneas says: *prope erat inquit Foebum occassu celeri imos inuisere priscos* ("It was near," he said, "for Phoebus with swift setting to visit the lowest ancients"). Terrentius: *necesse est inquit Gallos fieri fallaces* ("It is necessary," he said, "for Gauls to become deceitful"), and again: *facile est uirum uinci uiro uirtutis subito superueniente* ("It is easy for a man to be conquered by a man when virtue suddenly comes upon him").

There are adverbs which come from passive verbs, namely from participles of the past tense, such as *certatim* (competitively), *strictim* (closely), *dissipatim* (scatteredly), *congregatim* (collectively), which come from *congregatus*, *dissipatus*, *strictus*, and *certatus*. There are adverbs which are the same in letters as both nouns and verbs, such as *falso*. For we say *falso uos* (I deceive you); here it is a verb of the first conjugation, *falso falsas*; and in the ablative case, *falso nomine uocati sunt* (they were called by a false name); and adverbially we say *falso loqueris* (you speak falsely). There are adverbs whose condition is born from other parts of speech, such as *mecum*, *tecum*, *secum*, *nobiscum*, *uobiscum*. For *me* is the accusative case, but *cum* is a preposition of the ablative, and together they make an adverb. There are other adverbs which end in *-o*, but having received the letter *r* they make nouns from themselves, such as *docto*, *pasto*, *litterato*, *uastato*—to which if we add the same letter you will understand them to be nouns: *doctor*, *pastor*, *litterator*, *uastator*. There are other adverbs which are also nouns, such as *magister*; for in the nominative case *magister* is said of one who is a distinguished teacher, and adverbially *magister* is taken for *docte* (learnedly), as Lucanus says: *doctores etenim nostri magister omnia faciebant* ("For our teachers *magister* did all things").

There are also adverbs which, on account of the necessities of meters or on account of ancient custom, and—to speak more refinedly—on account of faulty invention, are either added to, such as *fortiositer* for *fortiter*, *comptose* for *compte*, or diminished, such as *audacter* for *audaciter*, *felicter* for *feliciter*. Some think that *heri*, *instar*, and *fas* are indeclinable nouns, but we do not doubt that they are adverbs. Adverbs of gathering are not of one status: for either they join and are stable, as *inuicem sumus* (we are mutually), or controversial, as *inuicem insurgimus* (we rise up against each other), or separative, as *abinuicem disiungimur* (we are separated from each other), or loving, as *pro inuicem laboramus* (we labor for one another). Many make adverbs from conjunctions, such as *ergo* and *tamen*—so that they put *ergo* for *sepe* (often), *tamen* for *inde* (thence), according to that saying of Virgilius Assianus: *ergo legunt sapientes tua scripta o Cato* ("*Ergo* the wise read your writings, O Cato")—that is to say, "often they read." And Cato himself: *tamen inquit reuersi Romam ueniunt* ("*Tamen*," he says, "having returned, they come to Rome")—that is, "thence having returned."

#### (9.) On the Participle

Concerning the participle, however—which is part of the noun and the verb, about which in the foregoing I think we have spoken sufficiently—now brief things must be said. The faithful among the learned understand gerund or typic verbs derived from participles thus: that *eligendi* is the genitive of a participle of a passive verb, of the future tense; and thus they define that the whole case in the singular number has been turned into this form in order, which has been derived by unusual Latinity. Whence also some have used the nominative case of this participle in the same form. For beyond this opinion our elders thought nothing ought to be felt about these verbs. They are called gerund verbs, moreover, because by some force they carry a work which was not theirs by nature. On this account they also adhere to the active verb. Typic verbs, however, are so called because they have been patterned from the aforesaid participle. When therefore it carries, then only does it receive the name of gerund; but the typic name, whether it carries or even does not carry, it will hold immovably.

The participles themselves, however, whenever they have been applied to verbs, will sound like verbs. Nor will they be separated by gesture, but thus they will use gesture compositively—as *legens eram* for *legebam* or *legi*, and *legens ero* for *legam*. Many of the ancients used to join two futures or two pasts, such as *saluandus ero* or *saluatus fui*, which will be permitted in the declension of the verb. But otherwise it should be said thus: *saluatus sum* or *saluandus sum*. For *sum* is a mobile verb, which participles carry with them according as they have been; so *es*, *est*, *sumus*, *estis*, *sunt*. In other tenses, however, they cannot be moved from their state.

There is a participle which Cato used to transfer into a verb—namely, of a passive verb, of the past tense—as that saying: *omnibus fratre patre matre coniuge reliquis necessariis proque carus falera factus* ("Dear to all—brother, father, mother, spouse, and remaining relations—and decorated for his service"), which nevertheless it would not have been permitted for him to do unless this participle closed the meaning of the whole testimony. Some, not knowing this, take *est* from elsewhere; but just as it is not at all permitted for them to do this, so indeed for others to transfer a participle into a verb apart from the manner we have described is perverse and unseemly.

#### (10.) On the Conjunction

Now let us say some things about the conjunction. All conjunctions seem to me to perform the function of a certain chain or bond, because they connect all sentences. Nevertheless some of them are said to separate—such as *autem* and *uero*—but only if they have been placed at the beginning of a phrase; in the middle of phrases, however, they will be held as copulative, as Aeneas composed: *cum itaque in theatro conuenissent multique conflictarentur, nonnulli autem sedare populum niterentur, alii uero in certamen populum concitarent, tum sol indigne ferens tantum a ciuibus haberi discordiam subito tenebris medio offusus die in mare uelut munitissimam urbem refugit* ("When therefore they had come together in the theater and many were struggling, but some were striving to calm the people, while others were inciting the people to conflict, then the sun, indignantly bearing that so much discord was held by the citizens, suddenly covered in darkness in the middle of the day, fled into the sea as if into a most fortified city"). Here, indeed, apart from *itaque*, the other three words—that is, *-que*, *autem*, *uero*—are simultaneously copulative with respect to what precedes.

Expletive conjunctions, however, are so called for two reasons: first, because they fill out the meaning of a phrase, or because they hold their place in meters, according to that saying of Cato: *uirile quoque certari conpetit agmen* ("The manly army *quoque* befits to contend"). Here indeed *quoque* has no reason except the filling out of the meter. Between *autem* and *enim* this is the difference: that *autem* changes and distinguishes the sense of phrases, *enim* glues them together. Between *uerum* and *uero* there are two differences: one, because *uerum* is of prepositive order, *uero* of subjunctive; the other, because *uerum* is held causally for *tamen*, *uero* is taken only for the filling out of its own station.

Although conjunction is divided into five species, nevertheless they intermix among themselves, so that each uses the account of another according to the quality of the phrases. For frequently causals are accustomed to be put for rationals and copulatives for causals—so that *et* is put for *enim*, as Cicero says: *uos uicistis et dii uos iuuerunt* ("You have conquered *et* the gods have helped you"), as if "you have conquered because the gods have helped you." *Quoniam* and *enim* are put for *tamen* and *si*, as Donatius the praetorian in his apologetic thus spoke: *quamquam me accusent, quoniam ego auctoritate certa fidens omnium probra tempno* ("*Quamquam* they accuse me, *quoniam* I, trusting in certain authority, despise the reproaches of all")—that is, "*tamen* I despise all." Lucanus also, writing about the weakness of the Tuscans: *enim inquit multos uiuant annos, non se umquam uindicabunt* ("*Enim*," he says, "may they live many years, they will never avenge themselves")—that is, "*si* they live."

*Quoniam*, if it has two verbs around it, will make the one subjoined to the prior and will precede the following, as Sulpicius writes: *iurabant, quoniam debellabant* ("They were swearing, *quoniam* they were conquering"); here the order is: "Therefore they were conquering, *quoniam* they were swearing." *Quidem* has two effects: for either it is prepared for preceding words or persons, or it proposes a sentence in either confirmative or destructive mode, and it is answered or refuted by such conjunctions—that is, *sed*, *tamen*, *autem*, *uerum*, *uero*. But if it is in the middle of the testimony, especially one that has another conjunction in its meaning, it will be taken for *tamen*. There is also *sed* of addition, to which *non solum*, *non tantum*, *non modo* are either placed before, or—even if not in letter, certainly in sense—are prepared beforehand, as Istrius says: *omnis homo prout ualet, uitat pericula, sed et suae uitae quaerit commoda* ("Every man, according to his strength, avoids dangers, *sed* also seeks the advantages of his life"). Here indeed the sense is: "Not only does he avoid those things, but also seeks these."

#### (11.) On the Preposition

A few things must be said about the preposition. For all prepositions which serve the accusative case are for the most part changed for one another in other types of Latinity. For we read with Gratianus: *naues apud mare nauigabant* ("Ships *apud* the sea were sailing")—that is, "through the sea"—and elsewhere: *demorati aliquandiu apud Constantinopolin sumus* ("Having delayed some time *apud* Constantinople")—*apud* for *in*.

*Circum*, if it is a preposition—which nevertheless rarely happens—will be written with *-m*; but if it makes a word, it should be written with *-n*, lest—as we have often noted—two vowels be thought to exist [...] whence when Origines the Athenian saw a certain person scribbling and read that phrase *circumdata munilibus et ornata uestitibus* (surrounded with ornaments and adorned with garments), smiling he said: "O Virgil, what are you doing? You ought to have become a writer rather than a reader; for he who strives to paint the scrawl of letters before he learns to understand their qualities, it will be necessary for him to err in each one. But you—do not write *circumdata* but *circundata*."

*Circa* and *erga* are two prepositions of the accusative case, but they have this difference: that *circa* pertains to visible matter or place, but *erga* looks to the mind, especially when it bears some more inclined affection of those close to one. Finally, also in philosophical Latinity, *ergum* is called affection; whence also those who drew the affection of all into themselves were thus called *ergo* by the ancients. *Aduersus* is said from adversity. Some show that *aduersum* is better written, which seems to me most satisfactory; for indeed two parts receive the preposition's accent if it goes for *contra*. Thus also *ante*, *prope*, *pone*, and *ultra* are immobile prepositions of the accusative case, nor are some cast about for others. Common prepositions, when they have the accusative case, are mobile; they are immobile when they adhere to the ablative.

#### (12.) On the Interjection

The signification of interjections, both because it is worn and because it has been judged by our people to be almost superfluous and disordered—I say only this: that *uae* and *eugae*, when they signify adverse things, will have a diphthong in their ending; but when *ue* only distinguishes and *euge* shows joy, it is not necessary to have a diphthong.
