### VIII. ON THE REMAINING PARTS OF SPEECH

---

With the edict concerning the principal parts having been treated as briefly as possible, separately through the individual parts—that is, concerning the noun, pronoun, and verb—now through the remaining parts of speech we are about to set forth, as if through a chronicle, one epitome only.

#### (8.) On the Adverb

The adverb is, as it were, an oblique servant to the verb, whose species is nevertheless multiform. For some designate place, some time. When you say *tum*, it signifies time, but when you say *tun*, it shows place, as Cato says: *utrique in Taurum coetus condixere montem, tun pugnauere totum collecti per diem* ("Both assemblies agreed upon Mount Taurus, *tun* they fought, gathered together through the whole day"). So also *con* is an adverb for *illuc* (thither), as Marcellus writes: *ite con arma ponite aerea secrete castris* ("Go *con*, lay down your bronze arms, secretly from the camps"). And these two joined together, *tuncon*, make an adverb of likeness for *tanquam* (as if), according to that saying of Lucanus: *et populus tuncon mare fluctuans consternari fecit terram* ("And the people *tuncon* the fluctuating sea caused the land to be terrified"). *Tanquam*: thus it ought to be said, as we explained above in the section on pronouns, lest two words be thought to exist at once by the unskilled.

Every adverb which is born from a noun, the ancients in the composition of cases used to join to nouns, as Glengus used to say: *uir in acie fortiter pro domo liberis et capite pugnat* ("A man in battle bravely fights for home, children, and life")—not, however, "bravely fights," but "man bravely." There are adverbs which are thought to be neuter nouns but are not, such as *longe*, *prope*, *necesse*, *facile*, *deficile*; but nevertheless, because *facilis* and *deficilis* are found very often, it would not be surprising if *facile* and *deficile* were also found as neuters—except that Aeneas denied this could happen. These adverbs are strong, which cooperate with a neuter verb so that it may act, if however they are taken from the infinitive mood—as if you should say: *longe est nos in his ulterius commorari locis* ("It is far for us to remain longer in these places"). Whence Aeneas says: *prope erat inquit Foebum occassu celeri imos inuisere priscos* ("It was near," he said, "for Phoebus with swift setting to visit the lowest ancients"). Terrentius: *necesse est inquit Gallos fieri fallaces* ("It is necessary," he said, "for Gauls to become deceitful"), and again: *facile est uirum uinci uiro uirtutis subito superueniente* ("It is easy for a man to be conquered by a man when virtue suddenly comes upon him").

There are adverbs which come from passive verbs, namely from participles of the past tense, such as *certatim* (competitively), *strictim* (closely), *dissipatim* (scatteredly), *congregatim* (collectively), which come from *congregatus*, *dissipatus*, *strictus*, and *certatus*. There are adverbs which are the same in letters as both nouns and verbs, such as *falso*. For we say *falso uos* (I deceive you); here it is a verb of the first conjugation, *falso falsas*; and in the ablative case, *falso nomine uocati sunt* (they were called by a false name); and adverbially we say *falso loqueris* (you speak falsely). There are adverbs whose condition is born from other parts of speech, such as *mecum*, *tecum*, *secum*, *nobiscum*, *uobiscum*. For *me* is the accusative case, but *cum* is a preposition of the ablative, and together they make an adverb. There are other adverbs which end in *-o*, but having received the letter *r* they make nouns from themselves, such as *docto*, *pasto*, *litterato*, *uastato*—to which if we add the same letter you will understand them to be nouns: *doctor*, *pastor*, *litterator*, *uastator*. There are other adverbs which are also nouns, such as *magister*; for in the nominative case *magister* is said of one who is a distinguished teacher, and adverbially *magister* is taken for *docte* (learnedly), as Lucanus says: *doctores etenim nostri magister omnia faciebant* ("For our teachers *magister* did all things").

There are also adverbs which, on account of the necessities of meters or on account of ancient custom, and—to speak more refinedly—on account of faulty invention, are either added to, such as *fortiositer* for *fortiter*, *comptose* for *compte*, or diminished, such as *audacter* for *audaciter*, *felicter* for *feliciter*. Some think that *heri*, *instar*, and *fas* are indeclinable nouns, but we do not doubt that they are adverbs. Adverbs of gathering are not of one status: for either they join and are stable, as *inuicem sumus* (we are mutually), or controversial, as *inuicem insurgimus* (we rise up against each other), or separative, as *abinuicem disiungimur* (we are separated from each other), or loving, as *pro inuicem laboramus* (we labor for one another). Many make adverbs from conjunctions, such as *ergo* and *tamen*—so that they put *ergo* for *sepe* (often), *tamen* for *inde* (thence), according to that saying of Virgilius Assianus: *ergo legunt sapientes tua scripta o Cato* ("*Ergo* the wise read your writings, O Cato")—that is to say, "often they read." And Cato himself: *tamen inquit reuersi Romam ueniunt* ("*Tamen*," he says, "having returned, they come to Rome")—that is, "thence having returned."

#### (9.) On the Participle

Concerning the participle, however—which is part of the noun and the verb, about which in the foregoing I think we have spoken sufficiently—now brief things must be said. The faithful among the learned understand gerund or typic verbs derived from participles thus: that *eligendi* is the genitive of a participle of a passive verb, of the future tense; and thus they define that the whole case in the singular number has been turned into this form in order, which has been derived by unusual Latinity. Whence also some have used the nominative case of this participle in the same form. For beyond this opinion our elders thought nothing ought to be felt about these verbs. They are called gerund verbs, moreover, because by some force they carry a work which was not theirs by nature. On this account they also adhere to the active verb. Typic verbs, however, are so called because they have been patterned from the aforesaid participle. When therefore it carries, then only does it receive the name of gerund; but the typic name, whether it carries or even does not carry, it will hold immovably.

The participles themselves, however, whenever they have been applied to verbs, will sound like verbs. Nor will they be separated by gesture, but thus they will use gesture compositively—as *legens eram* for *legebam* or *legi*, and *legens ero* for *legam*. Many of the ancients used to join two futures or two pasts, such as *saluandus ero* or *saluatus fui*, which will be permitted in the declension of the verb. But otherwise it should be said thus: *saluatus sum* or *saluandus sum*. For *sum* is a mobile verb, which participles carry with them according as they have been; so *es*, *est*, *sumus*, *estis*, *sunt*. In other tenses, however, they cannot be moved from their state.

There is a participle which Cato used to transfer into a verb—namely, of a passive verb, of the past tense—as that saying: *omnibus fratre patre matre coniuge reliquis necessariis proque carus falera factus* ("Dear to all—brother, father, mother, spouse, and remaining relations—and decorated for his service"), which nevertheless it would not have been permitted for him to do unless this participle closed the meaning of the whole testimony. Some, not knowing this, take *est* from elsewhere; but just as it is not at all permitted for them to do this, so indeed for others to transfer a participle into a verb apart from the manner we have described is perverse and unseemly.

#### (10.) On the Conjunction

Now let us say some things about the conjunction. All conjunctions seem to me to perform the function of a certain chain or bond, because they connect all sentences. Nevertheless some of them are said to separate—such as *autem* and *uero*—but only if they have been placed at the beginning of a phrase; in the middle of phrases, however, they will be held as copulative, as Aeneas composed: *cum itaque in theatro conuenissent multique conflictarentur, nonnulli autem sedare populum niterentur, alii uero in certamen populum concitarent, tum sol indigne ferens tantum a ciuibus haberi discordiam subito tenebris medio offusus die in mare uelut munitissimam urbem refugit* ("When therefore they had come together in the theater and many were struggling, but some were striving to calm the people, while others were inciting the people to conflict, then the sun, indignantly bearing that so much discord was held by the citizens, suddenly covered in darkness in the middle of the day, fled into the sea as if into a most fortified city"). Here, indeed, apart from *itaque*, the other three words—that is, *-que*, *autem*, *uero*—are simultaneously copulative with respect to what precedes.

Expletive conjunctions, however, are so called for two reasons: first, because they fill out the meaning of a phrase, or because they hold their place in meters, according to that saying of Cato: *uirile quoque certari conpetit agmen* ("The manly army *quoque* befits to contend"). Here indeed *quoque* has no reason except the filling out of the meter. Between *autem* and *enim* this is the difference: that *autem* changes and distinguishes the sense of phrases, *enim* glues them together. Between *uerum* and *uero* there are two differences: one, because *uerum* is of prepositive order, *uero* of subjunctive; the other, because *uerum* is held causally for *tamen*, *uero* is taken only for the filling out of its own station.

Although conjunction is divided into five species, nevertheless they intermix among themselves, so that each uses the account of another according to the quality of the phrases. For frequently causals are accustomed to be put for rationals and copulatives for causals—so that *et* is put for *enim*, as Cicero says: *uos uicistis et dii uos iuuerunt* ("You have conquered *et* the gods have helped you"), as if "you have conquered because the gods have helped you." *Quoniam* and *enim* are put for *tamen* and *si*, as Donatius the praetorian in his apologetic thus spoke: *quamquam me accusent, quoniam ego auctoritate certa fidens omnium probra tempno* ("*Quamquam* they accuse me, *quoniam* I, trusting in certain authority, despise the reproaches of all")—that is, "*tamen* I despise all." Lucanus also, writing about the weakness of the Tuscans: *enim inquit multos uiuant annos, non se umquam uindicabunt* ("*Enim*," he says, "may they live many years, they will never avenge themselves")—that is, "*si* they live."

*Quoniam*, if it has two verbs around it, will make the one subjoined to the prior and will precede the following, as Sulpicius writes: *iurabant, quoniam debellabant* ("They were swearing, *quoniam* they were conquering"); here the order is: "Therefore they were conquering, *quoniam* they were swearing." *Quidem* has two effects: for either it is prepared for preceding words or persons, or it proposes a sentence in either confirmative or destructive mode, and it is answered or refuted by such conjunctions—that is, *sed*, *tamen*, *autem*, *uerum*, *uero*. But if it is in the middle of the testimony, especially one that has another conjunction in its meaning, it will be taken for *tamen*. There is also *sed* of addition, to which *non solum*, *non tantum*, *non modo* are either placed before, or—even if not in letter, certainly in sense—are prepared beforehand, as Istrius says: *omnis homo prout ualet, uitat pericula, sed et suae uitae quaerit commoda* ("Every man, according to his strength, avoids dangers, *sed* also seeks the advantages of his life"). Here indeed the sense is: "Not only does he avoid those things, but also seeks these."

#### (11.) On the Preposition

A few things must be said about the preposition. For all prepositions which serve the accusative case are for the most part changed for one another in other types of Latinity. For we read with Gratianus: *naues apud mare nauigabant* ("Ships *apud* the sea were sailing")—that is, "through the sea"—and elsewhere: *demorati aliquandiu apud Constantinopolin sumus* ("Having delayed some time *apud* Constantinople")—*apud* for *in*.

*Circum*, if it is a preposition—which nevertheless rarely happens—will be written with *-m*; but if it makes a word, it should be written with *-n*, lest—as we have often noted—two vowels be thought to exist [...] whence when Origines the Athenian saw a certain person scribbling and read that phrase *circumdata munilibus et ornata uestitibus* (surrounded with ornaments and adorned with garments), smiling he said: "O Virgil, what are you doing? You ought to have become a writer rather than a reader; for he who strives to paint the scrawl of letters before he learns to understand their qualities, it will be necessary for him to err in each one. But you—do not write *circumdata* but *circundata*."

*Circa* and *erga* are two prepositions of the accusative case, but they have this difference: that *circa* pertains to visible matter or place, but *erga* looks to the mind, especially when it bears some more inclined affection of those close to one. Finally, also in philosophical Latinity, *ergum* is called affection; whence also those who drew the affection of all into themselves were thus called *ergo* by the ancients. *Aduersus* is said from adversity. Some show that *aduersum* is better written, which seems to me most satisfactory; for indeed two parts receive the preposition's accent if it goes for *contra*. Thus also *ante*, *prope*, *pone*, and *ultra* are immobile prepositions of the accusative case, nor are some cast about for others. Common prepositions, when they have the accusative case, are mobile; they are immobile when they adhere to the ablative.

#### (12.) On the Interjection

The signification of interjections, both because it is worn and because it has been judged by our people to be almost superfluous and disordered—I say only this: that *uae* and *eugae*, when they signify adverse things, will have a diphthong in their ending; but when *ue* only distinguishes and *euge* shows joy, it is not necessary to have a diphthong.


## XIII. ON THE SPLITTING OF WORDS

Aeneas was first among us accustomed to split words. When I was inquiring of him most diligently why he did this, he said: "O son, for three reasons are words split. The first is that we may test the acuteness of our students in seeking out and finding those things which are obscure. The second is for the beauty and edification of eloquence. The third is lest any mystic things, and those which ought to be revealed only to the knowing, be easily found everywhere by the lowest and foolish—lest, according to the ancient saying, pigs trample gems. For if they learn this sect, not only will they show no piety to their teachers, no honor or reverence will they bestow, but indeed in the manner of swine they will tear apart their own adorners."

The effect of splitting, however, is threefold. **The first** is that by which we split verses, as Cato says: *mare oceanum classes quod longae sepe turbatur simul nauigant* ("The ocean sea fleets which long often is disturbed together sail"). For he ought to have said: *mare oceanum sepe turbatur, classes quod longae simul nauigant* ("The ocean sea is often disturbed, which long fleets sail together").

**The second** is that by which we split the words themselves or syllables, as Lucanus produced: *-ge- ues- ro- trum- quando- tum- a- fec- om- ni- libet- aeuo-* and thus it is solved: *quandolibet uestrum gero omni aeuo affectum* ("Whenever I bear affection for you in every age").

**The third** kind is that by which we split letters. The splitting of letters, however, is superfluous; but nevertheless it is received by those of subtle glyphs and sense. Whence also it is more suitable to split short words than long ones. Cicero says: *rrr- ss- pp- mm- nt- ee- oo- a- v- l*, which is to be solved thus: **SPES ROMANORVM PERIT** ("The hope of the Romans perishes"). Virgilius Assianus also: *gggg- l- b- ff- rr- s- nnn- tt- e- ae- l vvv- ee-* which is solved thus: **GLEBAE GIGNVNT, FRVGES FERVNT** ("The soils produce, the crops bear"). Emilius the rhetor also elegantly says: *sss- sss- sss- ss- pp- nnnn- gggg- rr- mm- ct- td- cc- cc- cc- cc- cc- cc- cc- iii- ii- vvvv- vvvv- ee- ae- eeee- ee-* whose solution is this: **sapiens sapientiae sanguinem sugens sanguissuga uenarum factae uocandus est** ("A wise man must be called a leech of the blood of wisdom, a bloodsucker of the veins"). Galbungus also, weaving long lines in praise of the *indefuncti*, in his proem thus spoke: *pppp- ppp- rrr- rrr- lm- sss- nn- ttt- c- iiii- aaaaa- o- eee- eee-* which is solved thus: **primae partis procerae partes pleni pupis erant** ("The first parts of the lofty first part were full of the poop").

Furthermore, there are many who, after the manner of notaries, are accustomed to note down parts of Latinity—by a dissimilar writing indeed—with either single or double letters. As Virgilius Troianus to Auiceanus on a royal secret: *tibi si liberali omnem fertilitatem in agris, prolitatem in filiis, mulitatem in coniugibus, benedictionem in pecoribus per deos o* ("To you, if liberal, all fertility in fields, abundance in sons, multitude in wives, blessing in cattle, through the gods *o*"). He put one letter for the whole active verb which ends in *-o*, that is, *opto* (I wish). And Cicero concerning the sun: *magnum inquit laminare, quod totum circuit polum sol -ur-* ("A great luminary," he says, "which circles the whole pole, is the sun *-ur-*"); he put this for *nominatur* (is called).

Many furthermore split words for this purpose: that they may strive to compose and arrange them through syllables into certain arts. As Lucius on the noun: *nomen inquit in modos scindamus latinos ut mon, quod est signum grecum, nomo mone enne et ar* ("Let us split," he says, "the noun into Latin modes, such as *mon*, which is a Greek sign, *nomo*, *mone*, *enne*, and *ar*").

We ought to know that the philosophical account of the Latin arts has changed many words of all the arts; just as in verbs we find either superfluous addition or corruptible diminution: addition, when we find *rogauissem* or *rogauisse* written with a middle syllable added for *rogassem* and *rogasse*; diminution, when with the middle syllable likewise subtracted it is written *rogarunt* for *rogauerunt*, so *rogarant* for *rogauerant* and *rogarit* for *rogauerit*. Rhetors also are accustomed to add some syllables in modes for the sake of measuring feet and times, as is that: *rii uoluimus ionicum nauigabere pontum* ("*Rii* we wished to sail the Ionian *nauigabere* sea")—he put this for *nauigare*. The same elsewhere: *flamma aurum accensi probabat camini* ("The flame *probabat* the gold of the burning furnace")—for *probat*. They have also been accustomed to read nouns or pronouns with other letters in a manner far different from what was proper, such as *bonum* which should be *buonum*, and *ago* for *ego*, which we find in many places. Many have wanted to give another name to this pronoun, one which is closer in letters: *mius mei mihi*—this for *ego*. Who could encompass the various and manifold differences of Latinities, when they are so many that they cannot be numbered?

All parts of speech are accustomed to be split: **nouns**, so that where *regnum* (kingdom) is, *germen* may be put, as Lucanus says: *germen Romanorum rectum est* ("The shoot of the Romans is upright")—that is, *regnum*. **Pronouns** also are split, such as *si* for *is*, according to that saying of Alexander: *saluus sit, si qui contulit* ("May he be well, *si* who contributed")—that is, "*is* who contributed." **Verbs** also we split, such as *nodo* for *dono* and *gelo* for *lego*. **Adverbs** also, according to Hilarius: *locutus summus rhei* ("we spoke the highest *rhei*")—for *heri* (yesterday). **Participles** also they used to split when necessity compelled, as Cicero says: *sapientiam manas in actus exerit* ("wisdom puts forth *manas* into acts")—for *amans*. **Conjunctions** also are split, according to that saying of Cicero: *quasiunt uiues uita odibili* ("you will live *quasiunt* a hateful life")—*quasiunt* for *quatiunt*. **Prepositions** also are split, as Terrentius says: *quidque faciemus abs te* ("what shall we do *abs* you")—that is to say, *absque te quid faciemus* ("without you what shall we do"). Likewise: *nesi Deo in hac uiuitur colonia* ("*nesi* God one lives in this colony")—and this is *sine* (without). **Interjections** also are split, such as *tata* for *atat*.

Let each one of the skilled splitters know this: that he ought to take care of this first of all, that however he splits, the solution may prove how he splits; for it is not rightly solved by anyone after something that is not rightly placed before. Then whence he ought to presume to split Greek or Hebrew nouns or verbs, since this is not held in either language.

Cicero used to split words thus: that he placed the middle of a word in the first verse, and another middle in the second verse, according to that: *in que cuncti manebant simul collecti -do- iura ineuntes foedera munientes -mo-*—that is, *in domo* ("in a house"). He sometimes changed according to his custom, so that not only in endings but also in the middle or first parts of verses he would often insert split words, according to that: *hostes proponunt, o ciues, -da- dextras, uestro uersa iuri -re- uoce, gubernanti fato*—that is, *dare* ("to give"). And again: *-sur- sol succurrere clara fulgens luce -ge- gaudium ciuili pro portantibus salute*—that is, *surge sol* ("rise, sun"). This Cicero did in disyllables.

Likewise in trisyllables: *debeo ciuibus meam rem communibus -fac-, nec auaritiam secter in propriis -ce- malam, neu rapinam agam in externis -re-*—here he splits *facere* ("to do"). And again: *omne uisum ab homine -cu- delectabile natura sugante -pi- ipsi indita, ex quo non potest -ter- cupidine carere*—here he splits *cupiter*. Likewise he made a thoroughly cut prose thus: *-lau- contemptus pecuniae -da- in omni molimine -bi- per amorem philosophiae -lis- menti fiet perite*—that is, *laudabilis* ("praiseworthy").

Terrentius, changing the custom, drawing a syllable from this verse and another from that, either exchanged or diminished and added, according to that: *tempora -quae- -ra- praesuum suo sub iure finem finitum sibi -runt- mundi compage statuta*—that is, *quaerunt tempora praefinitum finem* ("times seek a predetermined end"). Likewise: *fortis ensem Aeneas forte portabat in -nu- pelta fidens -ma- tuta tela festim uincebat*—which is thus: *ensem in manu portabat* ("he was carrying a sword in his hand").

Varro also was seen to move letters through ten verses, according to that: *utinam, o uiri, dolorem pro uestris* **P**- *sicut pro suo genetrix gnato sustinet* -**A**-*; quis enim forti non dolet amico* -**T**-*, cum eum in multis uideat iniuste torqueri* -**E**-*? Cur ergo ne uos quidem hoc iusto uiuitis affectu* -**R**-*, uestris ut pro uestram cito hauriatis gazam* -**E**- *redimendis, quos iniqua proripuerat praeda* -**M**- *iniquorum ditioni, plebi superbitanti?* -**I**- *Noli itaque uestris parcere diuitiis* -**N**-*, cum sit magis cunctis bonus opibus amicus* -**I**-. Here the first word of the phrase, **PATEREMINI**, has been split.

Let us not therefore think it a new custom to split words, since it has been accustomed to happen from antiquity—which can be discovered by those who survey all the Italian and African schools, indeed the Latin schools placed in whatever part of the world. By these also another kind of splitting is accustomed to be taken up: that from two words which ought to be joined, with the first syllable taken from each, one word may be made—just as when we wish to teach order and faith, *orfi* is briefly named. Likewise when one explains life and discipline, *uidis* is chiefly pronounced. As the old man Donatus introduced: *uidi muesam*—who would understand? For they are accustomed to add another syllable from another word to an intact noun for the sake of supplement, such as *suaptum*; for *su* has been taken from *suauitas* (sweetness).

There are furthermore many kinds of splitting which teachers have handed down scattered in their books; yet none of them, I think, has produced a work of this exposition all the way to me. Therefore you do this which Aeneas had done for Vestra, offering to his wife a little song of thanksgiving for thanks to be given, who for him from *ropha* and *scephora* mixed with oil had made a *fer* almost unused by mortals, saying: "My wife, my riches, my glory, my grace, my breath—what thanks shall I repay to you, who have contrived to make for me a feast which not even the Roman kings themselves use?" If therefore the poet gives thanks for lowly vegetables, what thanks is it fitting to repay to our teachers for such sweet feasts of wisdom?

There are other laws of splitting, which nevertheless, because they are worn, I would wish to pass over in silence. But lest anyone consider himself defrauded even of a small gift, I shall put before you one testimony of this matter, which will give a close to my epitome. Let us take an example from hyperbaton, which is accustomed to place multiform and various interceptions of other little sentences in the same sentence upon what has been said; which fault indeed has a perverted order, yet almost immutably grows into authority through all the texts of readings.

Among which is that saying of Aeneas tearfully narrating the history—nay, the tragedy—of the Mithridatic War: "In that," he says, "indeed we propose to narrate (in what meter? dactylic) what we know to be the greatest war waged. In that, I say, and the same time in which I had completed the twenty-fifth year of my age (for Aeneas taught me that this was so), Blastus, a certain one Phrygian by race, an Iulian (which name he received from the poets because he seemed almost to devour men on account of his excessive savagery, which the Blasti are said to do); this one therefore from the north (for from this part he was destined to arise), coming to Rome with German satellites joined to himself—whose alliance and friendship he had equally acquired—with immense destruction made to the city's people and plebs through him, he divided the city into seven parts about to fight against each other and struck an intolerable blow, so that almost the whole city gave itself over to annihilation."

This order, however, of almost the whole testimony has been inverted; which we therefore leave indifferently, because both it is in anyone's power to arrange as he pleases, and the end of this little exposition is near. But it is the mark of wise writers to split words according to these examples which we have proposed.

## TRANSLATOR'S NOTES

### The Compression of Five Parts

Having devoted full chapters to noun, pronoun, and verb, Virgilius now treats adverb, participle, conjunction, preposition, and interjection in a single compressed chapter "as if through a chronicle" (*uelut per cronicen*). This structural decision reflects the traditional grammatical hierarchy placing noun and verb above the "minor" parts.

Law (1995) notes that this compression was common in late antique grammar, where the eight parts were often treated in unequal detail. Virgilius's term *cronicen* (chronicle) suggests a historical survey rather than systematic analysis.

### Invented Adverbs: *Tun*, *Con*, *Tuncon*

The adverbs *tun* (place, contrasted with *tum* for time), *con* (for *illuc*), and compound *tuncon* (for *tanquam*) are Virgilian inventions unattested elsewhere. Law suggests these represent either creative grammar or possibly obscure dialectal forms.

The warning that *tanquam* not be mistaken for "two words" (*duae uocales*) is characteristic—Virgilius invents words and then provides learned discussion of their proper usage, treating invented vocabulary with the same seriousness as inherited forms.

### Aeneas as Arbiter of Possibility

The statement that Aeneas "denied this could happen" (*hoc fieri posse negaret*)—that *facile* and *deficile* could function as neuter nouns—shows Aeneas determining not just what Latin is but what it can be. This positions the teacher as legislator of linguistic possibility.

### *Agapeta* and Christian Context

The term *agapeta* for "loving" adverbs of gathering (*pro inuicem laboramus*) derives from Greek ἀγαπητός. Since *agapetae* were consecrated virgins in the early Church, this may hint at Christian context. Herren (1979) notes several such possible Christian markers in Virgilius's vocabulary.

### The Solar Eclipse Passage

Aeneas's passage about the theater gathering—where the sun "indignantly bearing that so much discord was held by the citizens, suddenly covered in darkness in the middle of the day, fled into the sea as if into a most fortified city"—is remarkable for its moral cosmology. The sun acts as ethical agent, fleeing in disgust from human conflict.

Law suggests this may echo historical eclipse traditions, Christian moral exempla, or be purely Virgilian invention. The passage functions ostensibly to demonstrate conjunctions in context but achieves considerable rhetorical power.

### Origines the Athenian

The anecdote of "Origines the Athenian" (*Origines Atheniensis*) correcting a young Virgilius on spelling—"O Virgil, what are you doing?"—provides a rare personal glimpse, though its historicity is uncertain. The name echoes the great Alexandrian theologian Origen.

The paradoxical advice that one should be "a writer rather than a reader" before understanding letters inverts normal pedagogical sequence, suggesting that physical practice precedes intellectual understanding.

### *Ergum* as Philosophical Term

The claim that in "philosophical Latinity" (*latinitate filosofica*) *ergum* means "affection" exemplifies Virgilius's characteristic blending of grammar with philosophy, creating specialized technical vocabulary for his learned community.

### The Dismissal of Interjections

Virgilius dismisses interjections as "almost superfluous and disordered" (*pene superuacua atque incondita*), offering only a brief note on diphthongs. This dismissiveness contrasts with the extensive treatment of other parts and may reflect genuine grammatical opinion that interjections are marginal to systematic description.

### *Scinderatio*: Three Interpretations

The chapter on word-splitting (*scinderatio fonorum*) has puzzled scholars since Mai's 1815 edition. Three interpretations have been proposed:

**Cryptographic**: A system of secret writing to conceal meaning from the uninitiated. Herren (1979) connects this to Hiberno-Latin traditions of secret languages (*hisperica famina*).

**Pedagogical**: Exercises for teaching grammar through puzzle-solving. Law (1995) emphasizes the educational context, suggesting these were classroom games.

**Parodic**: Löfstedt (1984) reads the entire section as satirical exaggeration of grammatical obscurantism.

### Aeneas's Three Reasons for Splitting

Aeneas's explicit justification—testing students' acuteness, beautifying eloquence, and hiding mysteries from the unworthy ("lest pigs trample gems")—is striking. The third reason presents grammatical knowledge as esoteric wisdom requiring concealment.

The warning that those who learn this "sect" (*secta*) without proper reverence "will tear apart their own adorners in the manner of swine" suggests quasi-religious initiation. The language echoes Matthew 7:6 ("cast not your pearls before swine"), embedding grammatical practice within Christian moral discourse.

### The Letter Puzzles

The letter-frequency puzzles are genuinely solvable:

- Cicero's sequence = **SPES ROMANORVM PERIT** ("The hope of the Romans perishes")
- Virgilius Assianus's sequence = **GLEBAE GIGNVNT, FRVGES FERVNT** ("The soils produce, the crops bear")

Law notes these resemble medieval cryptographic games and may connect to Irish ogham traditions, where letters had numerical and symbolic values. The solutions require counting letter frequencies and arranging them into words.

### Galbungus's Verse for the *Indefuncti*

Galbungus "weaving long lines in praise of the *indefuncti*" (*in laudibus indefunctorum longas lineas texens*) presents a textual puzzle. The word *indefunctorum* is ambiguous: *defunctus* means "deceased" (one who has finished life), but the prefix *in-* could be either negative ("not deceased" = still living) or intensive (reinforcing "deceased").

If negative, this would mean "in praise of the living"—perhaps honorific verse for living patrons using funerary-style cryptographic techniques. If intensive or a scribal error for *defunctorum*, it means "in praise of the deceased"—memorial poetry requiring decipherment.

The solemn tone of the puzzle's solution and the context of elaborate letter-games suggest funerary or commemorative practice, but the possibility of praise for the living should not be excluded. This ambiguity may be deliberately Virgilian.

### The Invented Pronoun *Mius*

The pronoun *mius mei mihi* as "closer in letters" to *ego* exemplifies Virgilius's approach: Latin could have developed differently, and alternative forms illuminate the arbitrariness of actual usage. Such invented paradigms function as thought experiments about linguistic possibility.

### Varro's Acrostic: PATEREMINI

The ten-verse passage whose initial letters spell **PATEREMINI** ("you would suffer" or "allow") is an elaborate acrostic. Whether the historical Varro composed such verses or this is Virgilian invention is uncertain, but the technique itself—distributing a word letter by letter across verse-initial positions—is attested in ancient and medieval practice.

### Portmanteau Words

The practice of combining first syllables—*orfi* = *ordo* + *fides*, *uidis* = *uita* + *disciplina*—resembles modern portmanteau formation. Such "abbreviated" vocabulary may reflect actual scholarly shorthand or Virgilian invention, but the principle of morphological creativity is sound.

### Aeneas's Thanksgiving to Vestra

The passage where Aeneas offers his wife Vestra a "little song of thanksgiving" (*gratutum cantilicum*) for her cooking is unique in grammatical literature. The dish made from *ropha* and *scephora* mixed with oil—terms possibly Hebrew or invented—was "almost unused by mortals" and surpassed even royal cuisine.

This domestic scene—husband praising wife's cooking—humanizes the austere world of grammar. Virgilius's moral draws the analogy: if Aeneas thanks his wife for vegetables, how much more should students thank teachers for "sweet feasts of wisdom"?

### The "Mithridatic War" and Blastus

The chapter concludes with Aeneas narrating a garbled "Mithridatic War"—actually the story of Blastus, a Phrygian savage from the north with German allies who divided Rome into seven warring factions. This combines elements of Mithridates, barbarian invasions, and apocalyptic imagery.

The name Blastus (from Greek βλαστός, "sprout") is explained through folk etymology as from the Blasti who "devour men"—a tribe of cannibals whose name ironically means "offspring."

The autobiographical note—"the twenty-fifth year of my age (for Aeneas taught me that this was so)"—creates a curious loop: Virgilius says Aeneas taught him Aeneas's own age. This may be textual corruption, deliberate paradox, or a hint about the relationship between author and teacher.

### Italian and African Schools

The reference to "Italian and African schools, indeed Latin schools placed in whatever part of the world" (*scolas Italicas totas Africanasque, immo in quacumque poli parte positas latinas*) suggests awareness of a geographically dispersed Latin educational network. This supports dating Virgilius to the seventh century, when such networks still existed but were increasingly fragmented by political disruption.
