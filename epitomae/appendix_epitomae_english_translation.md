# VIRGILIUS MARO GRAMMATICUS
## APPENDIX TO THE EPITOMAE

*[Translator's note: This Appendix, as presented in Huemer's 1886 edition, preserves three fragments from different manuscript traditions that transmit Virgilian material in variant forms. These fragments—the Angelic, Montpellier, and Milan—demonstrate that Virgilius's work circulated in multiple recensions with different openings, vocabulary, and emphases. The variants are crucial for understanding the textual transmission and reception of Virgilius's work, and the Milan fragment's heading "Virgilius presbyter Hispanus" provides the only explicit statement of Virgilius's possible clerical status and geographic origin.]*

## I. THE ANGELIC FRAGMENT

*[This fragment comes from the Codex Angelicus (Rome, Biblioteca Angelica) and presents an alternative opening to the* Epitomae*, beginning not with Donatus of Troy but with Latinus, the eponymous ancestor of the Latin language.]*

### HERE BEGIN THE EPITOMES OF VIRGILIUS MARO.

Latinus, from whom Latinity derives. He is reported to have lived one hundred years. This man was great and powerful in war in royal times. The kinds of Latinity are twelve, which are called by these names: the first Latinity is *usitata*, the second *asena*, the third *semedia*, the fourth *numeria*, the fifth *metrofia*, the sixth *lumbrosa*, the seventh *sincolla*, the eighth *belsabia*, the ninth *bresina*, the tenth *militana*, the eleventh *spela*, the twelfth *polema*.

**Usitata** (ordinary) is so called since it is held in the use of Roman eloquence and by which Latin writings are inked—that is, written.

**Asena**—that is, notarial—which is content with only a letter for a whole sound.

**Semedia**—that is, neither wholly usual nor wholly unusual, such as *monta glosa*, that is, "not a forest," and *gilmola*, that is, *gula* (throat).

**Numeria**, which has its own numbers, such as *nim*, that is, one; *dun*, two; *tor*, three; *quur*, four; *quam*, five; *ses*, six; *sen*, seven; *onx*, eight; *adnim*, nine; *ple*, ten—which is said from plenitude—and thus *nimplexi* up to *plasin* for twenty, and *orasin* for thirty, *quur salim* for forty, up to *bectan* for one hundred, and *plasinus cophin* for one thousand, and the rest.

**Metrofia**—that is, intellectual—such as *dicantabat*, that is, "beginning"; *sade*, that is, "justice"; *gnoutilbea*, "fortitude"; *ter*, "duality," that is, "conjugal veneration"; *brop*, "piety"; *rip*, "hilarity"; *gal*, "kingdom"; *fal*, "religion"; *glip*, "nobility"; *mors*, "dignity"; *fanre*, "kinship"; *ult*, "honor"; *gabal*, "obedience"; *blath*, "light of the sun"; *merc*, "rain"; *pallias* and *mox*; *gab*, "peace"; *pin*, "water and fire"; *spat*, "longevity." By these things the whole world is governed and made prosperous.

**Lumbrosa**—that is, very long—when a whole verse is written for one ordinary word, such as *gabigayrum besingal fitelon*, that is, *legat* (let him read). *Biroc*, that is, "it is not useful to abandon a parent."

**Belsabia**—that is, perverted—when it transmutes the cases of nouns and mood of verbs, such as *legibus* means *lex* (law), and *rogo* means *rogate* (ask ye).

**Bresina**—that is, spacious—when one word signifies many ordinary things, such as *sur*: either "fields" or "eunuch" or "sword" or "river."

**Militana**—that is, multiform—when many words are put for one ordinary sound, such as for *cursus* (running): *gabon*, *sualin*, *rabat*, *sclon*.

**Spela**—that is, most lowly—which always speaks of earthly things, such as *sabon*, that is, *lepus* (hare); *gabal*, that is, *uulpes* (fox); *ganzagrus lena*, *gallina* (hen).

**Polema**—that is, figured—which treats of higher things, such as *allipha* for *anima* (soul); *spiridon* for *spiritus* (spirit); *nepote* for supernal virtues; *sanamia* for the unity of the high God.

## II. THE MONTPELLIER FRAGMENT

*[This fragment comes from a Montpellier manuscript and is titled "Differences of Words from the Epitomes of Virgilius." It presents semantic distinctions in a format resembling classical* differentiae *literature (cf. Isidore's* Differentiae*), with explicit cross-references to specific Epitomae and Epistolae chapters, suggesting derivation from a teaching context where both works were studied together.]*

### DIFFERENCES OF WORDS FROM THE EPITOMES OF VIRGILIUS.

It is one thing to say *non debet* (it is not owed), another *non oportet* (it is not fitting). For *oportere* is derived from *oportunitas* (opportunity); *debere*, however, from an insoluble debt. Whence also if you say *non oportet*, you do not so much forbid it to happen at all as show that it is not opportune. But when you say *non debet*, it is unowed if ever it should happen.

It is one thing to say *dicitur* (it is said), *locutus est* (he has spoken), and *dixit mihi* (he said to me). For *loqui* (to speak) belongs to a more leisurely eloquent person; *dicere* (to say), however, is referred simply and commonly to every utterance.

They also say that *uolo* (I wish) and *cupio* (I desire) are different. For *uelle* is understood with a certain sweet and legitimate will; *cupere*, however, belongs to immoderate desire.

They affirm that between *bellum* and *praelium* and *certamen* and *pugna* there is no small difference. For *praelium* (battle) can only be waged in *proelium*—that is, on the sea (*pelago*). It is therefore called *praelium* because, before the other elements, by a certain immensity in flooding and un-flooding they have a certain preeminence of admiration. *Bellum* (war), however, is only waged in *belsum*—that is, in a field. For *belsum* is so called because it brings forth very many *belsa*, which are grasses. *Certamen* (contest), however, is derived from a fixed place—that is, a receptacle of the army. In a *pugna* (fight), fighters (*pugilles*) cast their javelins, their fists (*pugiues*), on both sides.

They also say that *plebs* (common people) is one thing, *populus* (people) another. For *plebs* will be that which, overflowing with full fields and houses and every substance, is through this neither obstinate in war nor effective in learning. *Populus*, however, is so called from *pope*—that is, from the strength either of hands or of senses. Whence we criticize the grammarian Honoratus, who sings "the *plebs* was gathered in war" and in another place says "the *uerus* poet," thus he says. How foolishly he has spoken, when he ought to have said "*uerax* poet." For *uerus* refers only to the truth of nature; *uerax*, however, is said of one who by no means lies.

*Consumptio* (consumption) pertains to destruction; *consummatio* (consummation), however, to perfection.

---

### FROM EPITOME IV AND V.

When *tenebra* (darkness, singular) is said, a certain rust in daytime—that is, haze—is understood, and except for the accusative singular it is declined through all cases. But *tenebrae* (darknesses, plural) are the densest and deepest obscurities of nights. *Sol* (sun) is not forbidden to be declined in either number, but in the singular number *sol* will be the luminary itself; but we name *soles* (suns) the days themselves in which the sun illuminates the whole pole. Nevertheless, some ancients named poems themselves *soles*, as Oratius began at the start of a certain volume thus: *soles meos omni ecclesiae uestrae commendo* ("I commend my *soles* to your whole church").

There are many nouns which rejoice in double declension, such as *materies/materia*, *temperies/temperantia*, *caluities/caluitia/caluitium*, *segnities/segnitia*, *laetities/laetitia*, *requies/requia*, *facies/facia*. But there is much distance between these. *Segnitia* is of cold; *laetities* is of sudden benefit; *laetitia* is familiar; *requies* is refreshment from labor; *requia* is of idleness; *facies* is the surface itself; *facia* is likeness in a picture.

*Origo originis* is a beginning; but *origo origonis* is neuter and is a sail of a ship and has *origona* in the plural number. *Cantarus* (beetle) is an animal; *cantarus cantara*, we say, is a small house; *conclauum* is a house; *domicilium* is the nest of a bird. *Diluuium* is an immoderate inundation of water; *deluuium* is sanctification.

Between *operatio* and *opus* and *opera* this is the difference: *operatio* is of individuals; *opus* is general to every office; *opera*, however, in the singular number is a laborious care which especially tortures the soul.

---

### FROM EPITOME VI.

Between noun and pronoun this is the difference: that a pronoun, lacking comparison, has person, such as *ego*, *tu*, *ille*; a noun, however, with person cast aside, receives comparison, such as *carus*, *carior*, *carissimus*. We read that *mei* or *mis* is declined, but *mis* is said only of that thing which, promised to me by someone, I hope will come about; *mei*, however, of that thing which I possess at present.

---

### FROM EPITOME XI.

What is the difference between *uerbum* and *sermo* and *sententia* and *loquela* and *oratio*? *Uerbum* is everything that is uttered by tongue and voice. *Sermo*, however—whose name is composed from two words, that is, *serendo* (sowing) and *monendo* (admonishing)—is more elegant and careful. *Sententia*, indeed, is that which is conceived by the sense. Furthermore, *loquela* is when with a certain eloquence the order of speech is woven. *Oratio* is when the speech, having first prayed, reaches all the way to the art of the hands for writing.

**In Epitome IV.** Some wrongly want *loquelas* to be understood in elocution, whose *loquelae*, to be written with *-e-* and *-l-* as one, pertain to perfect eloquence.

---

### In VIII.

*Clamo* (I shout) is of simple crying. *Conclamo* is together with many. Also *acclamo* is when I falsely accuse someone, as Cicero says concerning Proviprassius: *solis innocens acclamationibus punitus est* ("Innocent, he was punished by acclamations alone"). *Reclamo* is calling back someone departing. *Inclamo* and *succlamo* are of murmuring. *Proclamo* is the exaltation of praising or deprecating. *Declamo* is rhetorizing. *Exclamo* is when I raise my voice with all my strength.

*Salto* (I dance) is presenting joy with a certain motion of the limbs, but in composition the letter changes: *exulto* (I exult), which is of joy uttered in the voice; *insulto* (I insult) is of mockery, injuriously. *Persulto* is when I make the sound penetrate through the ears of even those standing far off. *Resulto* (I resound) is when I respond loudly. *Consulto* (I consult) is the disposition of prudent counsel.

*Testor* (I testify) is confirming something by opinion. *Contestor* is affirming with a certain authority. *Protestor* is openly announcing things to be avoided. *Obtestor* is calling someone to testimony who is eminent in dignity or authority. *Detestor* is spurning something execrable.

*Iuro* (I swear) is testifying a true oath with a certain confirmation of swearing. *Periuro* (I perjure) is polluting an oath with falsehood. *Adiuro* is beseeching a greater power.

*Pono* (I place) is simply establishing something. *Dispono* (I arrange) is about to do something of more costly work or counsel. There is also *disponere* of entering into a treaty. *Propono* (I propose) sometimes pertains to questioning. *Appono* (I add) is of addition. *Inpono* (I impose) is of insinuating. *Superpono* (I place above) is imposing some tax or labor upon anyone. *Praepono* is preferring something, so also *antepono*. For *postpono* is judging another thing inferior. *Compono* (I compose) is of praying or of eloquence or of craft. *Sepono* (I set apart) is of separating. *Suppono* (I place under) is bringing something underneath. *Depono* (I put down) is of weakening or of departing from life.

---

### FROM LETTER X.

Between *uerum* and *uero* there are two differences: one, because *uerum* is of prepositive order, *uero* of subjunctive; the other, because *uerum* is held causally for *tamen* (nevertheless), *uero* is taken only for the filling out of its own station. Frequently causals are accustomed to be put for rationals and copulatives for causals, as Cicero: *uos uicistis et dii uos iuuerunt* ("You have conquered and the gods have helped you"). *Quoniam* is put for *tamen*. As Donatiuas the praetorian thus spoke: *quamquam me accusent, quoniam ego auctoritate fidens omnium probra temno* ("Although they accuse me, *quoniam* I, trusting in authority, despise the reproaches of all")—that is, "nevertheless I despise all." If *quoniam* has two verbs around it, it will make the one subjoined to the prior, as Sulpicius writes: *iurabant quoniam debellabant* ("They were swearing *quoniam* they were conquering")—here the order is: "Therefore they were conquering *quoniam* they were swearing."

---

## III. THE MILAN FRAGMENT

*[This fragment comes from the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan. Its heading—"Here follow etymologies. Virgilius, Spanish presbyter" (*Virgilius presbyter Hispanus*)—is the only explicit statement in the entire corpus of Virgilius's possible clerical status and geographic origin. If authentic, this places Virgilius in the Iberian Peninsula, possibly connecting him to the Visigothic intellectual milieu of seventh-century Spain. However, scholars debate whether the heading is original or a later scribal addition.]*

### HERE FOLLOW ETYMOLOGIES. VIRGILIUS, SPANISH PRESBYTER.

*Caelum* (heaven) is so called because it conceals certain great mysteries. The most skilled of philosophers call it "high heaven," as we have said. But they never signify height and depth. Indeed, the sea or whatever is placed beneath the earth is called *altum* (high/deep). As old man Donon, overcome by immense grief of bodily illness, enduring the night as though an exceedingly long tedium, and desiring day to come in the usual manner of the sick—as if it were about to bring some rest to his body—prayed in this fashion: *obsecro uos o alti quicumque estis, emittite ad me solem intra lucere, diem protinus allaturum* ("I beseech you, O you in the depths whoever you are, send forth to me the sun to shine within, about to bring day forthwith").

*Terra* (earth), because it is trodden by feet, but otherwise it is separated, because *ra* is a carrier, like *genitrix* (mother) in philosophical Latin. Whence ships which carry are called *rares*. Therefore *terra* is said threefold. First because we are born from it. Whence from *humus* (soil) *homo* (human) is said. Second because we are nourished by its fruits. Third because, released in death, we are hidden back into it as into a mother's womb.

*Mare* (sea) is said from bitterness; by the Hebrews, "collection of waters." By the philosophers it is composed from two words, as if "great thing" (*magna res*), known to no mortals.

*Stella* (star) from dripping (*stillando*). *Astra* from the variety of painting; for *aster* among philosophers means "painter." *Situs* (position) from a higher site. *Uolucer* (winged) from velocity. *Auis* (bird) from *auia*—that is, desert places. *Bestia* (beast) from *besus*—that is, fierceness. *Belua* is called a sea creature. For *bel* is called "sea" by the philosophers.

*Caro* (flesh) from the dearness of thought. *Corpus* (body) is said from the corruptibility of nature. But this is concerning a human. Otherwise, if everything that lies open to sight is called *corpus*, it must be asked whence *pus* is so called. *Pus* in philosophical Latinity means "custody." As Origenius says: *positis in pure fratribus solus euasit* ("With his brothers placed in *pure*, he alone escaped"). That is, in prison. *Corpus*, therefore, is said from the crown of surrounding and from the custody of retaining. *Caput* (head) from the capacity of taking. *Oculus* (eye) from concealing (*oculendo*). *Auris* (ear) is said from drawing in (*hauriendo*) what is heard.

*Pectus* (chest), in philosophical Latinity, is written with the addition of *-s-* from the fact that it looks toward the secrets of the heart. Whence Lucanus: *quando as pectore colitant cogitationes* ("When thoughts dwell in the chest"). But we say *pectus* from combing (*pectinando*)—that is, discerning thoughts. Whence it is also visibly compacted in the manner of a certain comb. Whence also what are badly thought in the chest are called *peccata* (sins).

*Ubera* (breasts) ought to be said only of women, from the abundance of milk. If anyone should wish to name *ubera* in men, they will be *uirilia*, which overflow abundantly with humors.

The philosophers called virtue and running *man* and *pen*. Of these nouns, through all cases, numbers, and genders, the declension is monoptote. From *man*, therefore—that is, virtue—*manus* (hands) are so called; and from *pen*, *pedes* (feet), which is from running.

*Labia* (lips) from the labor of speaking. My Aeneas understands another thing concerning this noun. "For this reason," he says, "lips are called *labia*, because daily through words they slip (*labuntur*) into fault."

*Lapis* (stone) from falling (*lapsu*). But more deeply, stones are said from their lamp-quality (*lampaditas*), because lamps are therefore kindled from them. Whence also precious stones from the splendor implanted in them. *Saxa* (rocks) are immense and immobile. *Petra* (rock) from hardness. For everything hard and untamed was called *petrum* by the ancients.

Whatever nouns like verbs have not sounded according to proximity are to be understood according to the sense and customs of writings.

*Menses* (months) from measure (*mensura*). The ancients from *mensa* (table), because they make a common table for all with their fruits. Whence also they want winter periods to be called not months but *spatia* (spaces).

*Gloria* (glory) is so called because whatever high things there are—such as gods among philosophers—are called *glores*. But more certainly *gloria* is said from the glorification of praise.

This should be known: that almost all things were said differently among the ancients and are now held differently among us. Among which is *gratia* (grace), which we say is that which is received freely and without price. They used to call it *gratula* from *gratulatio* (thanksgiving). We say *brachium* (arm) from *brachus*. For *brachium* in philosophical Latinity means "strength." They, however, called it *protentorium* from the fact that it is extended.

We say *dentes* (teeth) because they give (*dent*)—that is, to give strength to speech. They called them *rumini* because they gnaw all foods. Aeneas judged that teeth are better called *mandulae* from the fact that they chew (*mandunt*).

This same man used to say to me when I asked him what nature was: *O fili, scito quod uniuscuiusque rei natura est, in qua nascitur et sine qua omnino subsistere ac uiuere non potest, sicut homo sine actu, auis sine uolatu, piscis sine natatu* ("O son, know that the nature of each thing is that in which it is born and without which it cannot at all subsist and live—just as a human without action, a bird without flight, a fish without swimming").

## TRANSLATOR'S NOTES

### The Angelic Fragment: An Alternative Opening

The Angelic Fragment's opening with Latinus rather than Donatus of Troy represents a significant variant tradition. Latinus—the legendary king of Latium who welcomed Aeneas in Virgil's *Aeneid*—provides a more conventional mythological genealogy for Latin. His hundred-year lifespan contrasts with Donatus's legendary thousand years, suggesting a more sober tradition.

Law (1995) notes that the existence of alternative openings indicates the *Epitomae* circulated in multiple recensions, perhaps adapted for different teaching contexts or geographic regions.

### Variant Readings in the Twelve Latinities

The fragment preserves several significant variants: *Numeria* for *Numerosa*, *Bresina* for *Presina*, *gnoutilbea* (a compound form) for *bora* as "fortitude," and *monta glosa* glossed as "not a forest" rather than "high mountain." The number vocabulary also differs: *quur* for four, *sen* for seven, *adnim* for nine.

Herren (1979) suggests such variants may represent different scholastic traditions or regional adaptations of Virgilius's system. The vocabulary's resistance to etymological analysis supports both the hisperic tradition interpretation (genuine obscure vocabulary) and the parody interpretation (invented nonsense).

### The Montpellier Fragment: A Teaching Excerpt

The Montpellier Fragment's title—"Differences of Words from the Epitomes of Virgilius"—and its explicit cross-references ("From Epitome IV and V," "From Letter X") confirm its origin as a teaching compilation. The reference to "Egloga X" is significant: *egloga* (from Greek ἐκλογή, "selection") here means "letter," confirming that the *Epistolae* were also known as *Eclogae*.

Law observes that such cross-referencing suggests a pedagogical context where the *Epitomae* and *Epistolae* were studied together as a unified curriculum.

### Honoratus Grammaticus

The criticism of "Honoratus grammaticus" for writing *plebs in bello* and *uerus poeta* exemplifies Virgilius's prescriptivist method: attacking named authorities for semantic imprecision. This Honoratus is otherwise unknown and may be invented, but the technique—establishing authority through criticism of rivals—is characteristic of grammatical literature.

### The Inversion of *Plebs* and *Populus*

The distinction that *plebs* denotes wealthy landowners "neither obstinate in war nor effective in learning" while *populus* denotes those with strength inverts standard Roman understanding. In classical usage, *plebs* meant the common people while *populus* designated the citizen body. Virgilius's reversal may reflect deliberate wordplay, seventh-century social realities, or simply creative etymology.

### "Oratius" and *Soles*

The citation of "Oratius" (presumably Horace) writing *soles meos omni ecclesiae uestrae commendo* ("I commend my *soles* to your whole church") is puzzling on multiple levels. The word *ecclesia* (church) is anachronistic for Horace; *soles* meaning "poems" is unattested in classical Latin. This may be a garbled transmission, Christian reinterpretation, or Virgilian invention designed to demonstrate that even classical authorities used obscure vocabulary.

### *Donon* versus *Donatus*

The Milan Fragment names the old man "Donon" rather than "Donatus"—possibly a variant form, scribal error, or evidence of a different textual tradition. His prayer during illness is more elaborately framed here, with vivid description of nocturnal suffering and longing for dawn.

### *Presbyter Hispanus*

The heading identifying Virgilius as "Spanish presbyter" (*presbyter Hispanus*) is the only explicit statement of his origins in the entire corpus. If authentic, it places Virgilius in Visigothic Spain, contemporaneous with Isidore of Seville (d. 636). The designation *presbyter* indicates clerical ordination—Virgilius as priest, not merely grammarian.

However, Löfstedt (1984) and others question whether this heading is original or a later scribal addition, perhaps reflecting a scribe's guess about Virgilius's identity. The Spanish connection remains debated.

### Ships Called *Rares*

The Milan Fragment's expansion of the *terra* etymology adds a maritime dimension absent from the main text: *ra* = "carrier" (*portatrix*), whence ships are called *rares*. This otherwise unattested word exemplifies Virgilius's technique of inventing vocabulary to complete etymological systems.

### *Mare* as *Magna Res*

The philosophers' etymology of *mare* as composed from two words meaning "great thing" (*magna res*), "known to no mortals," adds mystical dimension—the sea as unknowable greatness. This contrasts with the main text's derivation from *amaritudo* (bitterness).

### *Auis* from *Auia*

The Milan Fragment derives *auis* (bird) from *auia* (trackless, desert places), not from *auiditas* (eagerness) as elsewhere. This alternative etymology—birds as creatures of wild places—may preserve a different learned tradition or represent Virgilian variation.

### The Comb-Like Chest

The observation that *pectus* (chest) is "visibly compacted in the manner of a certain comb (*pectis*)" refers to the ribcage's appearance. This anatomical observation—connecting etymology (*pectus* from *pectinando*, "combing") to visible structure—is unique to the Milan Fragment and demonstrates engagement with physical reality alongside linguistic speculation.

### Aeneas's Moral Etymology of *Labia*

Aeneas's alternative etymology for *labia*—"because daily through words they slip (*labuntur*) into fault"—adds moral dimension absent from the main text's simple derivation from *labor* (labor of speaking). This makes the lips instruments of moral failure, consistent with patristic concerns about sins of speech.

### Significance of the Fragments

These three fragments demonstrate that Virgilius's work circulated in variant forms, was excerpted for teaching purposes, and may have had multiple geographic origins or adaptations. The variants remind us that medieval texts were living documents, continuously adapted by scribes and teachers. The "presbyter Hispanus" designation, if authentic, would significantly affect understanding of Virgilius's identity and context—but its authenticity remains uncertain.
