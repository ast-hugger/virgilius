# PREFACE

*[Editor's Preface: Johannes Huemer, 1886]*

When four years ago I treated Virgilius Maro the grammarian at greater length, I had not yet thought about publishing these works. For I was uncertain whether this study of grammarians of the lowest age would be valued everywhere as highly as I myself valued it. Nevertheless, there were those who agreed with me in this matter; among them was that most outstanding investigator of metrical matters, Wilhelm Meyer, who at about the same time in that rather famous little book *Der Ludus de Antichristo* (Munich 1882) treated Virgilius as a teacher of rhythmical art with much praise. When other learned men, relying on the single edition of Angelo Mai—neither complete nor corrected—examined the grammatical precepts of Virgilius and his rather thorny manner of speaking, and a new edition was repeatedly desired, I no longer resisted the urging of friends to undertake the publication of the works of that grammarian long and greatly neglected, although I was convinced that I would be undertaking a work full of perilous risk.

For correcting Virgilius's little works I used those aids which I discussed in the commentary praised above; by good fortune certain fragments or excerpts from Virgilian codices were added. Finally, I confidently hope that others will bring new sources to light.

## Codices

**P** Codex Parisinus latinus 13026, ninth century, formerly of Corbie, marked with the number 540 (in the upper margin one reads "from the monastery of Corbie"), then Sangermanensis n. 1188, a parchment codex of larger format, contains many poets and writers on the arts of what they call the Silver Age of Latinity, namely: f. 1–10 the *Ars* of Eutyches on the verb (cf. Keil's *Grammatici Latini* vol. V 477 and *De grammaticis quibusdam latinis infimae aetatis* p. 5), f. 11a–40a the *Epitomae* of Virgilius Maro, mutilated at the end (ending with the words *...quod mihi videatur satissimum etenim duas partes praepositionem* f. 40a), f. 40b a fragment of a certain glossary beginning thus: *ango stringo; amita soror matris* etc. — f. 41a the *Ars* of Cruindmelus, mutilated with the eleventh quire cut away (cf. my edition p. IV) — f. 54 *effusum ingenii* (= Prudentius *Contra Symmachum* preface v. 78) — f. 73a (FINIT CONTRA SYMM); there follows *Eua columba fuit...* (= Prudentius *Dittochaeon* 1) and *pius fidelis innocens* (= epilogue) with the subscription EXPLICIT LIBER PRVDENTII METRICE ARTIS FELICITER DO GRATIAS AMEN, then *Tytiron ac segetes* (cf. *Anthologia Latina* n. 718 R), f. 76a INCIP DE PASIONE HYPOLITI BEATISSIMI MARTYRIS (= Prudentius *Peristephanon* XI), f. 78a *electio tibi Christe locus est* (= *Peristephanon* VIII), the fables of Avianus beginning *Dubitandi mihi theodosi* (cf. Froehner's edition p. 1) — f. 84a *promeruisse necem* (l. c. p. 49). After Avianus follow *prima deonei tollerata...* (cf. *Anthologia Latina* n. 641 R) and f. 84b *Est et non cuncti...* (cf. *Anthologia Latina* n. 645 R) and *ut belli...* (cf. *Anthologia Latina* n. 392 R); there follows ANCI MALII SEUERINI BOETHII DE CONSOLATIONE PHILOSOPHIAE the poems — f. 92b EXPLICIT METRICA ANCII MANILII SEUERINI etc., then *Perita fandi iam progressum comprime* (= Martianus Capella l. IV p. 136E) — f. 100b *quino stanto aequore ponti*, f. 101a *disparat obtritis que nos i. r.* (= Paulinus on St. Felix) — f. 120b *nunc opus adiutore deo solusque timendus*, f. 121a ΗΝ ΟΝΟΜΑ ΘΗ ΚΥΡΙ INCIPIUNT EGLOGE DE LIBRIS GRAMMATICORUM DE LITTERA ET SYLLABA ET ACCENTU ET POSITURIS *Disciplina a discendo nomen accepit* — f. 165b *primae coniugationis verba*, f. 161a *Verbum est pars orationis* (*ars malsachani* is written in the upper margin by another hand) — f. 181b, where certain things about dice are read; the book ends with a certain ascetic letter f. 182 expl ep. INCIP ep IOHANN... (the last words have vanished).

And the *Epitomae* of Virgilius, which begin from the first folio of the fifth quire (the number is depicted in the upper margin), have this inscription: ARS UIRGILII maronis | MARONIS VIRGILII ORIUNTUR AEPITHOMAE XV. PRIMA DE SAPIENTIA — f. 12b *Explicit Prima. incipit III* (sic) *de littera* — f. 13b *Explici syllabae sunt...* The following chapters, which are on meters, on the noun, on the pronoun, on the verb, have neither inscription nor subscription except that at f. 33b one reads *Explicit de coniunctatione. Incipit de numeris* — f. 36b after the chapter on the verb is finished EXPLICIT VIII — f. 37a INCIPIT NONA DE RELIQUIS PARTIBUS ORATIONIS.

The codex was written by one and the same scribe, though with varying ink. From words, syllables, and letters erased or placed above and below lines, and finally from dots very often added to letters, you may recognize the hand of a corrector or correctors. For he who wrote the codex seems to have corrected some things, but another person corrected many more things from the same exemplar, emending the errors of the first hand, wiping away the peculiarities of the archetype—all of which corrections I have carefully noted. Nevertheless, the book still teems with many errors, whether from the deformity of the exemplar from which this book flowed, or from the carelessness of the scribe, who seems to have been rather unlearned. The interchange of the vowels *e* and *i*, *ae* and *e*, *i* and *y*, *o* and *u*, *a* and *u* in primitive and final syllables of words is customary, whence you may easily understand what confusion could arise and often has arisen. *H* is sometimes added, sometimes omitted. The consonants *u* and *b*, *f* and *ph*, *f* and *p*, *p* and *b*, *d* and *t*, *l* and *r*, *r* and *s*, *r* and *n* and others are also interchanged—which types of interchanges, since they are very valuable for understanding the vulgar pronunciation of that time, I have not excluded from the critical apparatus. No less does it pertain to vulgar speech that the final letters *m*, *s*, *t* at the end of words are sometimes added superfluously, sometimes omitted. When the scribe did not understand the abbreviations, he wrote 14, 24 *tent* for *tenent*, 32, 9 *gene* for *genere*, 48, 7 *supta* for *sumpta*, and other things of this kind; he confused the word divisions in very many places such as 43, 12 *acre tenet*, 18, 13 *muli lautor nores logii necare nam cessi*. Finally, the spaces between syllables of the same word (cf. *sapi entia* 23, 3, *inde dicionem* 27, 22) can be explained by the fact that the scribe, being not sufficiently knowledgeable in the Latin language, was anxious about joining or separating syllables that were split at the end of lines in the exemplar.

**N** Codex Neapolitanus nr. IV A 34, a parchment codex in quarto of 289 folios, of which the earlier part (f. 1–91) is from the ninth century (as it seemed to Bethmann on cursory inspection) or tenth (as to G. Meyncke, to whom I owe the copy), while the later part was written a little afterward. Cat. Ianellius composed a sufficiently accurate description of the codex in the catalog of old and classical Latin manuscripts preserved in the royal Neapolitan Bourbon Museum p. 26. And that earlier part is contained in quires I–XI, while this more recent part is marked with new numbers, namely letters A–I written on the recto page (f. 92–167), the rest on the verso page (f. 168–289). These various parts of the writing were written by various hands. The book was formerly preserved at Rome in the library of the Farnese princes; in the twelfth century it seems to have belonged to a certain brother Wigradus, whose memorial from the last folio (289r) I published in the commentary mentioned above p. 16. The book is mutilated at the beginning; for it begins with the words: *ipsam rem exprimat et a ceteris rebus seiungat* = the commentary of Pompeius (cf. Keil *Gr.* l. p. 137, 17); it contains very many writings of grammarians, which I forbear to enumerate here after Ianellius.

The works of Virgilius fill f. 187–205. And the letters, which the Neapolitanus alone has preserved, are contained in the earlier folios (187v–205v), although it is understood from the author's own words that they were written after the *Epitomae*; the *Epitomae* are in the later folios f. 205r–217r. The letters are inscribed (f. 1 if you begin numbering from Virgilius) with these words painted in red: INCIPIT PRAEFATIO MARONIS — these words are subscribed at f. 18: FINIUNT BIS QUATERNE MARONIS EPISTOLAE FELICITER SALTORE PER SCRIPTAE — there follows IN NOMINE DEI PATRIS MARONIS VIRGILI ORDIUNTUR EPHITHOME divided and ordered into these chapters: INCIPIT I. DE UARIA RATIONE LATINITATIS — the first ends. INCIPIT SECUNDUS ID scenderatione fonorum — ends. INCIPIT IIII (sic) DE METRIS — INCIPIT IIII. DE COGNOMINATIONIBUS NOMINUM at. q. VERBORUM — ends. INCIPIT V. DE CATOLOGO (sic) GRAMMATICORUM — EXPLICIT MARONIS Virgilii. The *Epitomae* begin. The parts of speech which follow are not numbered, but have these inscriptions: DE LITTERA (according to Mai), De sillabis — De pronomine, DE VERBO, DE ADUERBIO, De participio, DE CONIUNCTIONE, DE PRAEPOSITIONE, DE INTERIECTIONE.

From the repeated subscription it may be gathered that the scribe either of the Neapolitan codex or of the exemplar from which it flowed changed the order of chapters so as to separate one part containing the eight parts of speech from another pertaining to general grammatical matters. About this matter, whereby the scribe was sometimes compelled to omit or change the author's words, I have treated more fully in the commentary mentioned p. 28 ff.

The codex was written by various hands and in a manner not unlike what they call Beneventan script, as it seemed to Meyncke. In that part which contains the works of Virgilius, there are marginal notes made by two hands, of which you will find certain specimens in the annotation. What corrections this book has suffered will be clear from the notes; but since it could not everywhere be discerned what is owed to the scribe and what to the corrector, I have mostly been content to indicate the corrections alone. And not only were obvious errors of the scribe corrected from an exemplar not different, but also the word forms peculiar to vulgar speech were emended—which however are so much rarer in this book as it is more distant in time from the archetype, to which that Parisian book approaches more closely. The corrector also added glosses in several places such as p. 42, 9 *divitia*: *causa*, 114, 1 *foni*: *voci*, 114, 6 *proclivem*: *productum*. Many things in the Neapolitanus are omitted, especially toward the end of the *Epitomae*, so that one might conjecture that the scribe, perhaps wearied by the long work, wished to diminish his labor for himself by mutilating the chapters and reducing them to his own use. But in the letters, which hold the first place, much less seems to have been omitted, which, since they are preserved in this one book alone, appears to have happened by the grace of Minerva.

From the Neapolitan book, Angelo Mai first and alone published the complete letters of Virgilius, but the *Epitomae* in shortened form, in volume V of the *Classici Auctores* p. 1–149. That most learned man, when he was about to prepare a second and corrected edition after examining the Neapolitan book anew, was snatched away by death. Part of the work begun but not finished was received into the appendix to the works published by A. Mai p. 113–166, which book appeared at Rome in the year 1871. G. Meyncke collated the codex for my use; A. Goldmann, at my request, inspected certain passages again.

## Fragments

**V** Five folios of the codex once at Salzburg (nr. 164) have now been reduced to the Vienna fragment 19556, about which, since I have treated more fully in the commentary mentioned several times, I forbear to discuss here. The lost codex was for the most part written in the ninth century.

**A** Of no less value is another fragment, which exists in the miscellaneous Angelic codex marked number V. 3. 22, with the inscription at f. 31r: INCIPIUNT EPITOME VIRGILII MARONIS. *Latinus a quo latinitas* — *pro unitate dei alti* (f. 32r). There precede verses of a certain doctor on the epigrams of Prosper, of which the last is: *sidereum celi cupiunt qui scandere regnum*; and following Virgilius is Augustine on the nine Muses in the book *De Doctrina Christiana*. This very useful fragment, which Arevalus first made public in his edition of Sedulius p. 425, I have published again in the appendix of this edition, copied for my use by G. Meyncke. The codex is from the tenth century (cf. Pertz *Arch.* XII 376).

The codex **Montpellier 306**, ninth century, f. 32 ff. (cf. *cat. gen. des départ.* I) contains excerpts from the *Epitomae* of Virgilius among the writings of many grammarians, with this inscription: DIFFERENTIAE SERMONUM EX EPITOMIS VIRGILII. *Aliud est dici* — *quoniam iurabant* (f. 34). There follows EX LIBRO CATONIS. *Sunt adverbia localia* — *id est non sana* (f. 35b). M. Bonnet, a learned and generous man, collated the book for my use. I have made public this not unuseful excerpt in the appendix.

Also in the **Milan codex** (of the Ambrosian library) M 79, eleventh century, p. 51r, there exists a certain excerpt from the *Epitomae* of Virgilius (cf. Montfaucon, *bibliotheca bibl.* p. 524 and Bethmann, *Archiv* XII p. 611) adorned with this inscription: HIC SECVNTVR ETHIMOLOGIE VIRGILIVS PRESBITER HISPANVS. *Caelum dicitur quia* — *piscis sine natatu* (p. 52v). There follows Isidore from the book of *Etymologies*. From a copy made by Ad. Cinquini of Milan, I have published the fragment for the first time in the appendix.

Besides these, I was able to use the **Nancy Excerpts**, which A. Collignon recently published from the Nancy book (formerly of Bobbio) n. 356, eighth–ninth century, cf. *Note sur une grammaire latine manuscrite du VIIIe siècle appartenant à la bibliothèque de Nancy contenant des fragments inédits de Virgilius Maro* (*Revue de philologie* vol. VII p. 13–22). And this book contains several grammatical writings, of which the chief is the *Glosa de partibus orationis*.

Composed in the same manner is the treatise on the adverb, which exists in the **Leiden codex** (Voss.) n. 33, tenth century, f. 76a–83a. Since Lindemann (*Ineditorum latinorum* part I, Zittau 1832) neither recognized nor published all the testimonies drawn from Virgilius, I examined the book anew when it was sent to Vienna and described the whole treatise, so that I might publish it when the opportunity arose. What pertains to Virgilius you will now find among the received testimonies.

Hermann Hagen gathered the testimonies of Virgilius from the art of codex **Bern 123**, tenth century, collected from many authors into one, in that book which is entitled *Anecdota Helvetica*, *Grammaticorum latinorum* vol. VII p. 189–201, with this title: Excerpts of Virgilius the grammarian, partly unpublished.

## On the Authority of Virgilius

How great an authority Virgilius the grammarian was in the Carolingian age as they call it and afterward, you will gather from the books of the most outstanding grammarians of those times. Our author was cited by **Bede the Venerable**, **Peter**, **Clement surnamed Scotus** (whose grammatical art I learned from the Bamberg codex M. V. 18), **Cruindmelus**, the anonymous author of the Bern art (cf. Hagen l. c. p. 62 ff.), to whom will perhaps be added others when the literature of the Carolingian age is brought to light.

## On the Archetype

That all the codices I have enumerated flowed from one archetype written in vulgar speech is proved by similarly corrupted spellings, cf. p. 4, 4 *parilla*] *per illa in* P, *perilla* N; 7, 13 *per ceras*] *per ceteras* PN, *preceteras* V; 9, 9 *invulae*] *muulae* V, *mulae* P, *mule* N; 10, 9 *indi mam assinso* P, *indi mam mas fensu* V; 15, 10 *duum*] *tuum* N, *trium* P; 18, 8 *Alexandrorum*] *alexandriagrorum* N, *alexander agnorum* P; 21, 21 *hele enim*] *elium* P, *eloim* N; 27, 5 *proprii*] *propre* P, *propri* N; 42, 14 *eandam*] *eadem* PN; 43, 12 *ac retinet*] *acre tenet* P, *acretinet* N; 71, 14 *nec gestu*] *nec estu* P, Nancy Excerpts.

And that archetype must have been written in Insular letters, since *fl* and *m*, *c* and *f*, *r* and *s*, *s* and *f*, *p* and *f* are often found interchanged, cf. 13, 25 *cantaum* for *cantuum* P, 50, 11 *questiunculum* P — 107, 18 *atquisierit* N, 147, 26 *praesumac* N — 24, 26 *sine* (for *fine*) *fenus* VN, 54, 13 *insinitivi* for *infinitivi* P — 9, 4 *inprimus* for *infirmus* N, 13, 18 *pona* for *fona* P, 109, 3 *patisfacere* for *satisfacere* N, 139, 22 *pingue* for *fingue* N, 140, 22 *faciens* N for *paciens*.

The Parisian codex precedes the Neapolitan in authority as in age, between which the Salzburg codex (now Vienna) must be thought to have held a certain middle place, since in several places it agrees with P, in certain others with N. But the excellence of the Parisian book, which almost every page of our edition demonstrates, is not such that you can neglect the other critical aids. Indeed, the others have brought much assistance for detecting errors born from vulgar language, with which the Parisian codex especially teems. But the testimonies of the grammarians, as many as I have gathered and placed below the text, have very rarely been useful for emending passages (cf. 116, 7; 157, 6). They drew indeed from sources not much corrupted, but they omitted what they did not sufficiently understand as being remote from usual speech, or what was not suitable or necessary for illustrating the questions being examined. Sometimes they also seem to have used Virgilius's words from memory, so that you labor in vain to investigate the testimony.

## On the Order of the Epitomae

It remains for me to add a few words about the order of the *Epitomae*, which I have established in this edition, and about the treatment of orthography. That Virgilius composed three times five *Epitomae* is clear from the author's own words. For he says at p. 121, 8 *...ego ipse in epitomis ter quinis numero proprium pronomini indixerim opusculum* ("I myself in the three times five *Epitomae* have assigned a proper treatise to the pronoun by number"). Moreover, the inscription of the Parisian codex has preserved this same number, cf. p. 1 MARONIS VIRGILII ORIVNTVR AEPITHOMAE XV. And you may easily establish the order of the earlier chapters from the inscriptions or subscriptions of the manuscripts thus: I. DE SAPIENTIA (P, N in margin), II. DE LITTERA (cf. subscription of Vienna codex), III. DE SYLLABA (?), IV. DE METRIS (N), V. DE NOMINE (?). But the chapter on the catalog of grammarians, which in N bears the number V (perhaps corrupted from XV), closed the work of the *Epitomae*, as we rightly gather both from the author's words placed at the end of the chapter p. 92: *Haec vobis o sodales atque discentes, legum paternarum libris pro cunctorum utilitate atque salute excepta insinuasse sufficiat* ("Let it suffice to have suggested these things to you, O companions and students, excerpted from the books of paternal laws, for the utility and salvation of all"), and from the subscription of the Neapolitan codex: *Explicit Maronis Virgilii*. *Epitomae* XIV and XIII, to which the author himself gave this name, I have joined with the final *Epitoma* on the authority of codex N. What comes between the earlier and later chapters, since the books do not hand down anything sufficiently certain, I have arranged by conjecture following the example of Virgilius's other work and the art of Donatus, prince of grammarians, so as to complete the number of three times five *Epitomae*.

## On Orthography

About orthography, what kind I should establish, I hesitated much and long, since I had seen neither the Virgilian codices sufficiently reliable nor the editors of authors of the lowest age consistent with themselves in this matter. Nevertheless, I did not wish to pass over entirely the orthographic differences, which I understood to be very valuable for elucidating the rules of vulgar pronunciation of that time, and to burden the critical apparatus excessively with these lighter matters as they will seem to many. Therefore I received into the text even the most unusual readings, fearing that by wiping away the peculiarities of spelling I would hinder grammatical studies more than help them. And I have much indulged the geminated consonants, since the books often agree in these, but I have not given the same trust to the instability of vowels, although you will find these too differing from vulgar usage. I myself concede that in this manner I have described the writing practice not so much of the author as of the scribes of both the Parisian and Neapolitan codices: that most editors of authors similarly do and have done this, although they have not convinced themselves of it, who is there who would deny? Moreover, the norms of orthography which we should follow in editing books of the Merovingian and Carolingian ages do not yet seem to me to be sufficiently investigated.

Finally, if you compare the edition of A. Mai, who deserved much from Virgilius the grammarian, with this one of ours, you will recognize how much and how many things I have corrected or wished to correct, although not a few things remain which need the help of an emender, so that by this edition the study of Virgilius the grammarian is begun rather than brought to completion. Since this is so, I venture to hope with firm mind that I will have many emenders, but no critic.

Lastly, it remains for me to give the greatest thanks to the learned men whom I have mentioned above as having either copied manuscripts for my use or inspected them at my request, but singular and very many thanks to Wilhelm von Hartel, from being my teacher the most benevolent patron of my studies, who helped me very much in this very difficult work and brought light to many and very obscure passages.

Given at Vienna in the month of October, 1886.
